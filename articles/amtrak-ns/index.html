			<p>Chicago&rsquo;s Union Station is the most connected rail station in the United States. It is a double stub-end terminal, meaining that trains can come from either the north or the south.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> As it turns out, all Amtrak lines, except for the <em>Empire Builder</em> and its subsets (<em>Hiawatha</em>, <em>North Star</em>), come to the south stub-end.</p>

<p>Most of this is due to Lake Michigan. Any direction to the east has to go around the south shore, including Michigan to the northeast. Thus, the north side has only <em>two</em> cardinal directions (north and northwest), whereas the south has the other six: everywhere from California to Massachusetts.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Most states are accessible from Chicago. Two (South Dakota and Wyoming) have no stations whatsoever. Alabama and the New England states have only regional access. And the other two are obviously not reachable by rail.</p>
