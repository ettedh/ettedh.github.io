&lt;h2 id=&#34;epistula-prima-tacito&#34;&gt;Epistula prima Tacito&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petis ut tibi avunculi mei exitum scribam, quo verius tradere posteris possis. Gratias ago; nam video morti eius si celebretur a te immortalem gloriam esse propositam. Quamvis enim pulcherrimarum clade terrarum, ut populi ut urbes memorabili casu, quasi semper victurus occiderit, quamvis ipse plurima opera et mansura condiderit, multum tamen perpetuitati eius scriptorum tuorum aeternitas addet. Equidem beatos puto, quibus deorum munere datum est aut facere scribenda aut scribere legenda, beatissimos vero quibus utrumque. Horum in numero avunculus meus et suis libris et tuis erit. Quo libentius suscipio, deposco etiam quod iniungis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erat Miseni classemque imperio praesens regebat. Nonum Kal. Septembres hora fere septima mater mea indicat ei apparere nubem inusitata et magnitudine et specie. Usus ille sole, mox frigida, gustaverat iacens studebatque; poscit soleas, ascendit locum ex quo maxime miraculum illud conspici poterat. Nubes⁠—incertum procul intuentibus ex quo monte; Vesuvium fuisse postea cognitum est⁠—oriebatur, cuius similitudinem et formam non alia magis arbor quam pinus expresserit. Nam longissimo velut trunco elata in altum quibusdam ramis diffundebatur, credo quia recenti spiritu evecta, dein senescente eo destituta aut etiam pondere suo victa in latitudinem vanescebat, candida interdum, interdum sordida et maculosa prout terram cineremve sustulerat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnum propiusque noscendum ut eruditissimo viro visum. Iubet liburnicam aptari; mihi si venire una vellem facit copiam; respondi studere me malle, et forte ipse quod scriberem dederat. Egrediebatur domo; accipit codicillos Rectinae Tasci imminenti periculo exterritae⁠—nam villa eius subiacebat, nec ulla nisi navibus fuga⁠—ut se tanto discrimini eriperet orabat. Vertit ille consilium et quod studioso animo incohaverat obit maximo. Deducit quadriremes, ascendit ipse non Rectinae modo sed multis⁠—erat enim frequens amoenitas orae⁠—laturus auxilium. Properat illuc unde alii fugiunt, rectumque cursum recta gubernacula in periculum tenet adeo solutus metu, ut omnes illius mali motus omnes figuras ut deprenderat oculis dictaret enotaretque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iam navibus cinis incidebat, quo propius accederent, calidior et densior; iam pumices etiam nigrique et ambusti et fracti igne lapides; iam vadum subitum ruinaque montis litora obstantia. Cunctatus paulum an retro flecteret, mox gubernatori ut ita faceret monenti &amp;ldquo;Fortes&amp;rdquo; inquit &amp;ldquo;fortuna iuvat: Pomponianum pete. Stabiis erat diremptus sinu medio⁠—nam sensim circumactis curvatisque litoribus mare infunditur⁠—ibi quamquam nondum periculo appropinquante, conspicuo tamen et cum cresceret proximo, sarcinas contulerat in naves, certus fugae si contrarius ventus resedisset. Quo tunc avunculus meus secundissimo invectus, complectitur trepidantem consolatur hortatur, utque timorem eius sua securitate leniret, deferri in balineum iubet; lotus accubat cenat, aut hilaris aut⁠—quod aeque magnum⁠—similis hilari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim e Vesuvio monte pluribus locis latissimae flammae altaque incendia relucebant, quorum fulgor et claritas tenebris noctis excitabatur. Ille agrestium trepidatione ignes relictos desertasque villas per solitudinem ardere in remedium formidinis dictitabat. Tum se quieti dedit et quievit verissimo quidem somno; nam meatus animae, qui illi propter amplitudinem corporis gravior et sonantior erat, ab iis qui limini obversabantur audiebatur. Sed area ex qua diaeta adibatur ita iam cinere mixtisque pumicibus oppleta surrexerat, ut si longior in cubiculo mora, exitus negaretur. Excitatus procedit, seque Pomponiano ceterisque qui pervigilaverant reddit. In commune consultant, intra tecta subsistant an in aperto vagentur. Nam crebris vastisque tremoribus tecta nutabant, et quasi emota sedibus suis nunc huc nunc illuc abire aut referri videbantur. Sub dio rursus quamquam levium exesorumque pumicum casus metuebatur, quod tamen periculorum collatio elegit; et apud illum quidem ratio rationem, apud alios timorem timor vicit. Cervicalia capitibus imposita linteis constringunt; id munimentum adversus incidentia fuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iam dies alibi, illic nox omnibus noctibus nigrior densiorque; quam tamen faces multae variaque lumina solvebant. Placuit egredi in litus, et ex proximo adspicere, ecquid iam mare admitteret; quod adhuc vastum et adversum permanebat. Ibi super abiectum linteum recubans semel atque iterum frigidam aquam poposcit hausitque. Deinde flammae flammarumque praenuntius odor sulpuris alios in fugam vertunt, excitant illum. Innitens servolis duobus assurrexit et statim concidit, ut ego colligo, crassiore caligine spiritu obstructo, clausoque stomacho qui illi natura invalidus et angustus et frequenter aestuans erat. Ubi dies redditus⁠—is ab eo quem novissime viderat tertius⁠— corpus inventum integrum illaesum opertumque ut fuerat indutus: habitus corporis quiescenti quam defuncto similior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim Miseni ego et mater⁠—sed nihil ad historiam, nec tu aliud quam de exitu eius scire voluisti. Finem ergo faciam. Unum adiciam, omnia me quibus interfueram quaeque statim, cum maxime vera memorantur, audieram, persecutum. Tu potissima excerpes; aliud est enim epistulam aliud historiam, aliud amico aliud omnibus scribere. Vale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epistula-secunda-tacito&#34;&gt;Epistula secunda Tacito&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ais te adductum litteris quas exigenti tibi de morte avunculi mei scripsi, cupere cognoscere, quos ego Miseni relictus⁠—id enim ingressus abruperam⁠—non solum metus verum etiam casus pertulerim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quamquam animus meminisse horret,⁠&amp;hellip; incipiam.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profecto avunculo ipse reliquum tempus studiis⁠—ideo enim remanseram⁠—impendi; mox balineum cena somnus inquietus et brevis. Praecesserat per multos dies tremor terrae, minus formidolosus quia Campaniae solitus; illa vero nocte ita invaluit, ut non moveri omnia sed verti crederentur. Irrupit cubiculum meum mater; surgebam invicem, si quiesceret excitaturus. Resedimus in area domus, quae mare a tectis modico spatio dividebat. Dubito, constantiam vocare an imprudentiam debeam⁠—agebam enim duodevicensimum annum⁠—posco librum Titi Livi, et quasi per otium lego atque etiam ut coeperam excerpo. Ecce amicus avunculi qui nuper ad eum ex Hispania venerat, ut me et matrem sedentes, me vero etiam legentem videt, illius patientiam securitatem meam corripit. Nihilo segnius ego intentus in librum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iam hora diei prima, et adhuc dubius et quasi languidus dies. Iam quassatis circumiacentibus tectis, quamquam in aperto loco, angusto tamen, magnus et certus ruinae metus. Tum demum excedere oppido visum; sequitur vulgus attonitum, quodque in pavore simile prudentiae, alienum consilium suo praefert, ingentique agmine abeuntes premit et impellit. Egressi tecta consistimus. Multa ibi miranda, multas formidines patimur. Nam vehicula quae produci iusseramus, quamquam in planissimo campo, in contrarias partes agebantur, ac ne lapidibus quidem fulta in eodem vestigio quiescebant. Praeterea mare in se resorberi et tremore terrae quasi repelli videbamus. Certe processerat litus, multaque animalia maris siccis harenis detinebat. Ab altero latere nubes atra et horrenda, ignei spiritus tortis vibratisque discursibus rupta, in longas flammarum figuras dehiscebat; fulguribus illae et similes et maiores erant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tum vero idem ille ex Hispania amicus acrius et instantius &amp;ldquo;Si frater&amp;rdquo; inquit &amp;ldquo;tuus, tuus avunculus vivit, vult esse vos salvos; si periit, superstites voluit. Proinde quid cessatis evadere?&amp;rdquo; Respondimus non commissuros nos ut de salute illius incerti nostrae consuleremus. Non moratus ultra proripit se effusoque cursu periculo aufertur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nec multo post illa nubes descendere in terras, operire maria; cinxerat Capreas et absconderat, Miseni quod procurrit abstulerat. Tum mater orare hortari iubere, quoquo modo fugerem; posse enim iuvenem, se et annis et corpore gravem bene morituram, si mihi causa mortis non fuisset. Ego contra salvum me nisi una non futurum; dein manum eius amplexus addere gradum cogo. Paret aegre incusatque se, quod me moretur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iam cinis, adhuc tamen rarus. Respicio: densa caligo tergis imminebat, quae nos torrentis modo infusa terrae sequebatur. &amp;ldquo;Deflectamus&amp;rdquo; inquam &amp;ldquo;dum videmus, ne in via strati comitantium turba in tenebris obteramur.&amp;rdquo; Vix consideramus, et nox⁠—non qualis illunis aut nubila, sed qualis in locis clausis lumine exstincto. Audires ululatus feminarum, infantum quiritatus, clamores virorum; alii parentes alii liberos alii coniuges vocibus requirebant, vocibus noscitabant; hi suum casum, illi suorum miserabantur; erant qui metu mortis mortem precarentur; multi ad deos manus tollere, plures nusquam iam deos ullos aeternamque illam et novissimam noctem mundo interpretabantur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nec defuerunt qui fictis mentitisque terroribus vera pericula augerent. Aderant qui Miseni illud ruisse illud ardere falso sed credentibus nuntiabant. Paulum reluxit, quod non dies nobis, sed adventantis ignis indicium videbatur. Et ignis quidem longius substitit; tenebrae rursus cinis rursus, multus et gravis. Hunc identidem assurgentes excutiebamus; operti alioqui atque etiam oblisi pondere essemus. Possem gloriari non gemitum mihi, non vocem parum fortem in tantis periculis excidisse, nisi me cum omnibus, omnia mecum perire misero, magno tamen mortalitatis solacio credidissem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tandem illa caligo tenuata quasi in fumum nebulamve discessit; mox dies verus; sol etiam effulsit, luridus tamen qualis esse cum deficit solet. Occursabant trepidantibus adhuc oculis mutata omnia altoque cinere tamquam nive obducta. Regressi Misenum curatis utcumque corporibus suspensam dubiamque noctem spe ac metu exegimus. Metus praevalebat; nam et tremor terrae perseverabat, et plerique lymphati terrificis vaticinationibus et sua et aliena mala ludificabantur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobis tamen ne tunc quidem, quamquam et expertis periculum et exspectantibus, abeundi consilium, donec de avunculo nuntius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haec nequaquam historia digna non scripturus leges et tibi scilicet qui requisisti imputabis, si digna ne epistula quidem videbuntur. Vale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;diglossic-r&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-letter-to-tacitus&#34;&gt;First letter to Tacitus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your request that I would send you an account of
my uncle&amp;rsquo;s end, so that you may transmit a more
exact relation of it to posterity, deserves my acknowledgements;
for if his death shall be celebrated
by your pen, the glory of it, I am aware, will be
rendered for ever deathless. For notwithstanding he
perished, as did whole peoples and cities, in the
destruction of a most beautiful region, and by a misfortune
memorable enough to promise him a kind of
immortality: notwithstanding he has, himself, composed
many and lasting work⁠—I am persuaded that
the mentioning of him in your immortal writings
will greatly contribute to eternize his name. Happy
I esteem those, whom Providence has gifted with the
ability, either to do things worthy of being written,
or to write in a manner worthy of being read; but
most happy they, who are blessed with both talents,
in which latter class, my uncle will be placed both by
his own writings and by yours. The more willingly
do I undertake⁠—nay, solicit⁠—the task you set me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was, at that time, with the fleet under his
command at Misenum. On the ninth day before the Kalends of September,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
about one in the afternoon, my mother desired him
to observe a cloud of very unusual size and appearance.
He had sunned himself, then taken a cold
bath, and after a leisurely luncheon, was engaged in
study. He immediately called for his shoes and
went up an eminence, from whence he might best
view this very uncommon appearance. It was not at
that distance discernible from what mountain this
cloud issued, but it was found afterwards to be
Vesuvius. I cannot give you a more exact description
of its figure, than by resembling it to that of a pinetree,
for it shot up a great height in the form of a
trunk, which extended itself at the top into several
branches; because I imagine, a momentary gust of
air blew it aloft, and then failing, forsook it; thus
causing the cloud to expand laterally as it dissolved,
or possibly the downward pressure of its own weight
produced this effect. It was at one moment white,
at another dark and spotted, as if it had carried up
earth or cinders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle, true savant that he was, deemed the
phenomenon important and worth a nearer view.
He ordered a light vessel to be got ready, and gave
me the liberty, if I thought proper, to attend him.
I replied that I would rather study; and, as it happened,
he himself had given me a theme for composition.
As he was coming out of the house he received a
note from Rectina, the wife of Bassus, who was in
the utmost alarm at the imminent danger (his villa
stood just below us, and there was no way to escape
but by sea); she earnestly entreated him to save her
from such deadly peril. He changed his first design
and what he began with a philosophical, he pursued
with an heroical, turn of mind. He ordered large
galleys to be launched, and went himself on board
one, with the intention of assisting not only Rectina,
but many others; for the villas stand extremely
thick upon that beautiful coast. Hastening to the
place from whence others were flying, he steered his
direct course to the point of danger, and with such
freedon from fear, as to be able to make and dictate
his observations upon the successive motions and
figures of that terrific object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now cinders, which grew thicker and hotter
the nearer he approached, fell into the ships, then
pumice-stones too, with stones blackened, scorched,
and cracked by fire, then the sea ebbed suddenly
from under them, while the shore was blocked up by
landslips from the mountains. After considering for a
moment whether he should retreat, he said to the
captain who was urging that course, &amp;ldquo;Fortune
favors the bold; carry me to Pomponianus.&amp;rdquo;
Pomponianus was then at Stabiae, distant by half
the width of the bay (for, as you know, the shore,
insensibly curving in its sweep, forms here a
vessel
for the sea). He had already embarked his
baggage; for thougn at Stabiae the danger was not
yet near, it was fully in view, and certain to be extremely
near, as soon as it spread; and he resolved
to fly as soon as the contrary wind should cease. It
was fully favorable, however, for carrying my uncle
to Pomponianus. He embraces, comforts, and encourages
his alarmed friend, and in order to soothe
the other’s fears by his own unconcern, desires to be
conducted to a bathroon; and, after having bathed, he
sat down to supper with great cheerfulness, or at
least (what is equally heroic) with all the appearance
of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, Mount Vesuvius was blazing in
several places, with spreading and towering flames,
whose radiant brightness the darkness of the night
set in high relief. But, my uncle, in order to soothe
apprehensions, kept saying that some fires had been
left alight by the terrified country people, and what
they saw were only deserted villas on fire in the
abandoned district. After, this he retired to rest, and
it is most certain that his rest was a most genuine
slumber; for his breathing, which, as he was pretty
fat, was somewhat heavy and sonorous, was heard by
those who attended his chamber-door. But the
court which led to his apartment now lay so deep
under a mixture of pumice-stones and ashes, that if
he had continued longer in his bedroom, exiting would
have been impossible. After being awakened, he came
out, and returned to Pomponianus and the others, who
had sat up all night. They consulted together as to
whether they should hold out in the house, or to
wander about in the open. For the house now
tottered under repeated and violent concussions, and
seemed to rock to and fro as if torn from its
foundations. In the open air, on the other hand,
they dreaded the falling pumice-stones, light and
porous though they were; yet this, by comparison,
seemed the lesser danger of the two; a conclusion
which my uncle arrived at by balancing reasons, and
the others by balancing fears. They tied pillows
upon their heads with napkins; and this was their
whole defense against the showers that fell round
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now day everywhere else, but there, a
deeper darkness prevailed than in the most obscure
night; relieved, however, by many torches and
different lights. They thought it proper to go
down to the shore to observe from close at-hand,
if they could possibly put out to sea, but they found
the waves still running extremely high and contrary.
There, my uncle, having thrown himself down upon a
disused sail, repeatedly called for, and drank, an
amount of cold water; soon after, flames, and a
strong smell of sulphur⁠—which was the forerunner of
them⁠—dispersed the rest of the company in flight;
and only roused him. He raised himself up with
the assistance of two of his slaves, but instantly fell;
some unusually-gross vapor, as I conjecture, having
obstructed his breathing and blocked his windpipe,
which was not only naturally weak and constricted,
but chronically inflamed. When day dawned again
(the third day from the last he had seen) his body was
found entire and uninjured, and still fully-clothed as
in life; its posture was that of a sleeping, rather
than a dead man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile my mother and I were at Misenum.
But this has no connection with history, and your
inquiry went no farther than concerning my uncle’s
death. I will, therefore, put an end to my letter.
Suffer me only to add, that I have faithfully related
to you what I was either an eye-witness of myself, or
heard at the time, when report speaks most true.
You will select what is most suitable to your
purpose; for there is a great difference between a
letter, and a history; between writing to a friend,
and writing for the public. Farewell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-letter-to-tacitus&#34;&gt;Second letter to Tacitus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter which, in compliance with your request,
I wrote to you concerning the death of my uncle,
has raised your curiosity, you say, to know not only
what terrors, but what calamities I endured when
left behind at Misenum (for there I broke off my
narrative)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Though my mind shudders to remember,⁠&amp;hellip; I will begin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle having set out, I gave the rest of the
day to study⁠—the object which had kept me at home.
After which, I bathed, dined, and retired to short
and broken slumbers. There had been, for several
days before, some shocks of earthquake, which
alarmed us less, as they are frequent in Campania;
but that night, they became so violent that one might
think that the world was not being merely shaken,
but turned topsy-turvy. My mother flew to my
chamber; I was just rising, meaning on my part to
awaken her if she was asleep. We sat down in the
forecourt of the house, which separated it by a short
space from the sea. I do not know whether I should
call it courage or inexperience⁠—I was not quite
eighteen⁠—but I called for a volume of Livy, and
began to read, and even went on with the extracts I
was making from it, as if nothing were the matter.
Lo and behold, a friend of my uncle&amp;rsquo;s, who had just
come to him from Spain, appears on the scene;
observing my mother and me seated, and the fact that
I have a book in my hand, he sharply censures her
patience and my indifference; nevertheless, I still
went on intently with my author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now six o’clock in the morning, the light
still ambiguous and faint. The buildings around us
already tottered, and though we stood upon open
ground, as the place was narrow and confined,
there was certain and formidable danger of them
collapsing. It was not till then we resolved to quit
the town. The common people follow us in the
utmost consternation, preferring the judgement of
others to their own (wherein the extreme of fear
resembles prudence), and force us onwards by
pressing a crowd in on our rears. Having arrived outside
the houses, we halt in the midst of a most strange
and dreadful scene. The coaches which we had
ordered out, though stood upon the most level ground, were
sliding to and fro, and could not be kept steady even
when stones were put against the wheels. Then we
beheld the sea sucked back, and as it were repulsed
by the convulsive motion of the earth; it is at least
certain than the shore was considerably enlarged, and
now held many sea animals captive on the dry sand.
On the other side, a black and dreadful cloud,
bursting out in gusts of igneous, serpentine vapor,
now and again yawned open to reveal long, fantastic
flames, resembling flashes of lightning, but much
larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Spanish friend already mentioned now spoke
with more warmth and instancy: “If your brother⁠—
if your uncle,” said he, “is still alive, he wishes you
both to be safe; if he has perished, it was his
desire that you would survive him. Why therefore
do you delay your escape?” &lt;i&gt;We could never think of
our own safety,&lt;/i&gt; we said, &lt;i&gt;while we are uncertain of his.&lt;/i&gt;
Without further ado, our friend hurried off, and took
himself out of danger at the top of his speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon afterwards, the cloud I have described began
to descend upon the earth, and cover the sea. It
had already encircled the hidden Capreae, and blotted
from sight the promontory of Misenum. My mother
now began to beseech, exhort, and command me to
escape as best I might; a young man could do it;
she, burdened with age and corpulency, would die
easy if only she had not caused my death. I replied,
I would not be saved without her, and taking her by
the hand, I hurried her on. She complies reluctantly
and not without reproaching herself for delaying me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashes now fall upon us, though as yet in no great
quantity. I looked behind me; great darkness
pressed on our rears, and came rolling over the
land after us like a torrent. I proposed while we
still could see, to turn aside, lest we should be knocked
down into the road by the crowd that followed us, and
trampled to death in the dark. We had scarce sat
down, when darkness spread over us⁠—not like that of
a moonless or cloudy night, but of a room when
it is shut up, and the lamp put out. You could
hear the shrieks of women, the crying of children,
and the shouts of men; some were seeking their
children, others their parents, others their wives, or
husbands, and only distinguishing them by their
voices; one lamenting his own fate, another that of
his family; some praying to die, from the very fear
of dying; many lifting their hands to the gods; but
the greater part, imagining that there were no gods
left anywhere, and that the last and eternal night
had come upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were even some who augmented the real
perils by imaginary terrors. Newcomers reported
that such-and-such a building at Misenum had collapsed
or taken fire⁠—falsely, but they were credited. By
degrees it grew lighter; which we imagined to be
rather the warning of approaching fire (as in truth it
was) than the return of day: however, the fire stayed
at a distance from us: then again came darkness, and
a heavy shower of ashes; we were obliged every now
and then to rise and shake them off, otherwise we
should have been buried and even crushed under their
weight. I might have boasted, that amidst dangers so
appalling, not a sigh or expression of fear escaped
from me, had not my support been founded in that
miserable though strong consolation, that all mankind
were involved in the same calamity, and that I
was perishing with the world itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, this dreadful darkness was attenuated by
degrees to a kind of cloud or smoke, and passed
away; presently the real day returned, and even the
sun appeared, though pale as when an eclipse is
in progress. Every object that presented itself to
our yet-affrighted gaze was changed, covered over with
a drift of ashes, as with snow. We returned to
Misenum, where we refreshed ourselves as well as
we could, and passed an anxious night between hope
and fear⁠—though indeed with a much larger share of
the latter, for the earthquake still continued, and
several enthusiastic people were giving a grotesque
turn from their own and their neighbors’ calamities by
terrible predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, however, my mother
and I, notwithstanding the danger that passed and which still threatened us, had no thoughts
of leaving the place till we should receive some
tidings of my uncle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, you will read this narrative, so far
beneath the dignity of a history, without any view of
transferring it to your own; and indeed you must
attribute it to your own request, if it appears scarcely
worthy of a letter. Farewell.&lt;/p&gt;

Believed to be a mistake in the manuscript. &amp;ldquo;Despite the date of August 24th is widely accepted in the literature&amp;hellip; the most probable date must necessarily fall between October 24th and November 1st.&amp;rdquo; Doronzom M, &lt;i xml:lang=&#34;la&#34;&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104072&#34;&gt;The 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; &lt;i&gt;Earth-Science Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, 2022:104072.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;domus-fama&#34;&gt;Domus fama&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbe locus medio est inter terrasque fretumque&lt;br&gt;
caelestesque plagas, triplicis confinia mundi,&lt;br&gt;
unde quod est usquam, quamvis regionibus absit,&lt;br&gt;
inspicitur, penetratque cavas vox omnis ad aures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fama tenet summaque domum sibi legit in arce,&lt;br&gt;
innumerosque aditus ac mille foramina tectis&lt;br&gt;
addidit et nullis inclusit limina portis:&lt;br&gt;
nocte dieque patet. Tota est ex aere sonanti,&lt;br&gt;
tota fremit vocesque refert iteratque quod audit.&lt;br&gt;
Nulla quies intus nullaque silentia parte,&lt;br&gt;
nec tamen est clamor, sed parvae murmura vocis,&lt;br&gt;
qualia de pelagi, siquis procul audiat, undis&lt;br&gt;
esse solent, qualemve sonum, cum Iuppiter atras&lt;br&gt;
increpuit nubes, extrema tonitrua reddunt.&lt;br&gt;
Atria turba tenet: veniunt, leve vulgus, euntque&lt;br&gt;
mixtaque cum veris passim commenta vagantur&lt;br&gt;
milia rumorum confusaque verba volutant.&lt;br&gt;
E quibus hi vacuas inplent sermonibus aures,&lt;br&gt;
hi narrata ferunt alio; mensuraque ficti&lt;br&gt;
crescit, et auditis aliquid novus adicit auctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illic Credulitas, illic temerarius Error&lt;br&gt;
vanaque Laetitia est consternatique Timores&lt;br&gt;
Seditioque recens dubioque auctore Susurri.&lt;br&gt;
Ipsa, quid in caelo rerum pelagoque geratur&lt;br&gt;
et tellure, videt totumque inquirit in orbem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;diglossic-r&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;domo-fama&#34;&gt;Domo fama&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estas loko inter lando kaj maro&lt;br&gt;
kaj ĉielo, triobla limo monda,&lt;br&gt;
de kie io ajn, de ie ajn, vidiĝas,&lt;br&gt;
kaj ĉiu voĉo eniras orelojn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famo posedas ĉi tie domon ĉe la supro de turo,&lt;br&gt;
mil aperturoj aldonitaj al la konstruaĵo kaj neniuj pordoj fermeblaj;&lt;br&gt;
ĝi apertas tra nokto kaj tago. Ĉiu sono devas resoni,&lt;br&gt;
kaj voĉoj denove diritaj kiuj estas aŭditaj.&lt;br&gt;
Neniu kvietaĵo troviĝas kaj neniu parto silentas,&lt;br&gt;
nek tamen klamo aŭdiĝas, krom la murmuradeto de voĉo,&lt;br&gt;
kiel ondoj, kiuj aŭdiĝus de malproksima maro,&lt;br&gt;
aŭ kiel sono, kiam Jupitero krakis&lt;br&gt;
nigrajn nubojn, laste revenas tondrinte.&lt;br&gt;
La brua halo havas amasojn venantajn kaj irantajn,&lt;br&gt;
kaj mensogoj vagas miksitaj kun veraĵoj,&lt;br&gt;
mil onidiroj  kaj konfuzitaj vortoj vadas kune;&lt;br&gt;
el kiuj, kelkaj plenigas malplenajn orelojn per diraĵoj;&lt;br&gt;
kelkaj rakontitaj portiĝas al alia, kiujn ili aŭdis, kaj la mezuro de fikcio&lt;br&gt;
kreskas, kaj ĉiu nova verkisto aldiras ion al aŭditoj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tie restas Kredeco, temerara Eraro,&lt;br&gt;
kaj vana Ĝojo, kaj alarmata Timo,&lt;br&gt;
kaj freŝa Ribelo, kaj Susuro el necerta verkisto.&lt;br&gt;
Famo mem, kiu elrigardis la aferojn en la ĉielo kaj maro&lt;br&gt;
kaj grundo, vidas, kaj petas ĉiun en la mondo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
