<p><img alt="Figure 1. Natural divisions of the Chicago Region" src="/cdiv.webp"></p>
<h3 id="morainal-natural-division">Morainal Natural Division</h3>
<p>Young and rolling morainal topography close to Lake
Michigan. The boundary follows the outer edge of the
Valparaiso Moraine except in the northwest, where the
line is based on geological features and presettlement
vegetation.<sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="1a-western-morainal-section">1A. Western Morainal Section.</h4>
<p>Mostly end moraines. Soils with a high clay content
and often a perched water table. Primarily prairie
and savanna, with isolated areas of mesic woodland
and forest.</p>
<h4 id="1b-eastern-morainal-section">1B. Eastern Morainal Section.</h4>
<p>Eastern portion of the Valparaiso Morainal
system. Geologically similar to 1A, but a break is
made based on the predominant plant communities. Mostly
timbered with savannas and forests.</p>
<h4 id="1c-kettle-moraine-section">1C. Kettle Moraine Section.</h4>
<p>Characterized by truncated end moraines, outwash
features, kame and kettle topography, an unconsolidated
aquifer, and glacial lakes. Savannas were once the
principal plant community, interspersed with prairies,
sedge meadows, fens, small spring-fed streams,
and marshes.</p>
<h4 id="1d-racine-till-plain-section">1D. Racine Till Plain Section.</h4>
<p>Mostly end and ground moraines; timbered principally
with mesic savanna or forest. Ravines along Lake
Michigan include a number of boreal relict plants.</p>
<h4 id="1e-winnebago-drift-section">1E. Winnebago Drift Section.</h4>
<p>Altonian substage of the Wisconsinan glaciation,
earlier than other sections of the Morainal Natural
Division. Topography somewhat more level and wetlands
less common; streams more entrenched and drainage
patterns better developed. Savannas and dry prairies
predominated.</p>
<h4 id="1f-fox-river-bluff-section">1F. Fox River Bluff Section.</h4>
<p>Characterized by moderately high bluffs along the lower
Fox River Valley, and associated outwash features and
dolomite outcrops. Seepage areas and fens occur along
the bluffs. Included within the Morainal Division
because of the fens similar to those in 1C, and
extensive woodlands associated with the bluffs.</p>
<h3 id="lake-plain-natural-division">Lake Plain Natural Division</h3>
<p>Characterized by lacustrine deposits and aeolian
dunes. Included within the Morainal Division by
previous authors.</p>
<h4 id="2a-chicago-lake-plain-section">2A. Chicago Lake Plain Section.</h4>
<p>Once covered by glacial Lake Chicago; consists of
nearly level lacustrine silt and clay deposits. Mesic
and wet prairie and marsh originally extensive.</p>
<h4 id="2b-gary-lake-plain-section">2B. Gary Lake Plain Section.</h4>
<p>Includes the Tolleston, Calumet, and Glenwood beach
ridges and intervening often slightly acidic sand
flats. Characterized by sand savannas with intervening
wet sand prairies and marshes.</p>
<h4 id="2c-benton-harbor-lake-plain-section">2C. Benton Harbor Lake Plain Section.</h4>
<p>Topographically similar to 2B, but originally mostly
wooded with rich swamps and mesic forests.</p>
<h4 id="2d-illinois-dunes-section">2D. Illinois Dunes Section.</h4>
<p>Low beach ridges and swales at Illinois Beach State
Park and Chiwaukee Prairie support an open community of
sand prairie, sand savanna, and marsh. Two additional
sand areas of irregular shape which once existed on
the lake plain were probably similar; these are within
the present limits of Evanston and Chicago.</p>
<h4 id="2e-ridge-and-swale-section">2E. Ridge and Swale Section.</h4>
<p>Formed only within the past 6,000 years, characterized
by alternating parallel low ridges and swales. Ridges
consist of relatively alkaline sandy soils and are
covered by sand prairie and a sparse savanna of black
oak and jack pines, wetlands characterized by pannes
and open water.</p>
<h4 id="2f-high-dune-section">2F. High Dune Section.</h4>
<p>Narrow band along Lake Michigan; includes a unique
high dune complex of communities.  Prevailing winds
which build the dunes also bring higher than normal
snowfall, moderate temperatures, and new sand.
Regularly timbered with black oak and white pine
savanna, becoming more regularly forested northward.</p>
<h3 id="grand-prairie-natural-division">Grand Prairie Natural Division</h3>
<p>The grand prairie once covered much of east-central
Illinois. The northeastern portion of this natural
region enters the Chicago region.</p>
<h4 id="3a-grand-prairie-section">3A. Grand Prairie Section.</h4>
<p>Mostly end and ground moraines; level to gently
rolling. Characterized by taligrass prairie, with
timbered communities limited to the margins of rivers
and well-drained morainic ridges.</p>
<h4 id="3b-kankakee-sand-section">3B. Kankakee Sand Section.</h4>
<p>Aeolian and lacustrine sand deposits, mostly on the
south side of the Kankakee River.  Sand savannas are
frequent on dunes, interspersed with wet to dry sand
prairie, sand flatwoods, marsh, and shrub swamps.</p>
<h4 id="3c-kankakee-marsh-section">3C. Kankakee Marsh Section.</h4>
<p>Vast wetlands which once bordered the Kankakee River in
Indiana; marsh was probably the predominant community
type, areas of true swamp and riparian savanna were
present.</p>
<h4 id="3d-bedrock-valley-section">3D. Bedrock Valley Section.</h4>
<p>Dolomite exposed along the Des Plaines River by
scouring from the outflow of glacial Lake Chicago. The
Kankakee torrent cut down to underlying dolomite from
Momence to the confluence with the Des Plaines. In the
Illinois River Valley, shale and sandstone exposures
are more prevalent. Unique communities include dolomite
cliffs and prairie, typically interspersed with sedge
meadow and marsh.</p>
<h3 id="glacial-lakes-natural-division">Glacial Lakes Natural Division</h3>
<p>Only one section of the Northern Lakes Division enters
the eastern part of our region.</p>
<h4 id="4a-glacial-lakes-section">4A. Glacial Lakes Section.</h4>
<p>Exhibits complex and uneven ice-contact terrain
deposited by a stagnating glacier.<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Moraines, kames, and outwash plains are
present, and kettle ponds, lakes, and swamps are
numerous. Extensive forests, with savannas on steep
slopes. Lakes, swamps, bogs, fens, and marshes are
interspersed.  This section is expanded to include a
gravel outwash fan, formerly mapped as part of 3B.</p>
<h2 id="natural-plant-communitites">Natural Plant Communitites</h2>
<p>The Chicago region, situated at the southern end of Lake Michigan, lies along the northeastern edge
of the Tall Grass Prairie biome of the Midwest. The prevailing landscape at the time of settlement was
open prairie. In some areas the prairie was flat, in others rolling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly, the most remarkable feature of the state of Illinois is its extensive prairies, or non-wooded
tracts. They begin on a comparatively small scale in the basin of lake Erie, and already form the bluff
of the land about lake Michigan, the Upper Wabash, and the Illinois, &hellip; or rather, the whole of this
tract may be described as prairie intersected by patches of woodland, chiefly confined to the river
valleys. The characteristic peculiarity of the prairies is the absence of timber; in other respects, they
present all the varieties of soil and surface that are found elsewhere; some are of inexhaustible fertility,
others of hopeless sterility; some spread out in vast boundless plains, others are undulating or rolling,
while others are broken by hills. In general, they are covered with a rich growth of grass, forming
excellent natural meadows, from which circumstance they take their name. Prairie is a French word,
signifying meadow, and is applied to any description of surface that is destitute of timber and
brushwood, and clothed with grass. Wet, dry, level, and undulating, are terms of description merely,
and apply to prairies in the same sense as they do to forest lands. The prairies of Illinois may be classed
under three general divisions;&ndash;the healthy, or bushy; the alluvial, or wet; and the dry, or undulating.
Those [that] have springs of water, &hellip; are covered with bushes of hazel and furze, small sassafras
shrubs interspersed with grape-vine, and in the season of flowers become beautifully decorated by a rich
profusion of gay herbaceous plants.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prairies were regularly interspersed with poorly drained flatland, and the hills were commonly
characterized by hanging fens and seepage slopes where the water-filled high grounds discharged a
constant flow of clear water into wet meadows and marshes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between the Plein and Theakaki, the country is flat, wet, and swampy, interspersed with prairies of an
inferior quality of soil.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout the region were small to large tracts of savannas consisting of open-grown timbers,
mostly of Bur and White Oak. Eastward, around the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the lake shore rose
up in high wooded dunes covered mostly in White Pine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The northern part of Illinois is beautifully diversified with groves of timber and rolling prairies. The
shores of Michigan have a large supply of pine timber, and from this source the lumber for buildings
at Chicago is obtained. &hellip; The stage road, from Michigan City to Chicago, is, most of the way, on
the sandy beach. Chicago &hellip; is built on a level prairie, open in full view to the Lake, and the soil
is enough mixed with sand, to prevent its being muddy.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; there were along where Michigan Avenue now is walled with palatial mansions innumerable sand
hills rising to a considerable height, overrun by the wild juniper loaded with its fragrant berries at the
feet of which stretched away to the southeast the soft smooth beach of firm glistening sand &hellip; along
the beach north of the river where also the drifting sand has been piled by the shifting winds into a
thousand hills stretching farther back from the waters than on the south, but here the juniper bush was
replaced by a stunted growth of scraggy pines often hilled up by the drifting sand. &hellip; Further back was
a broad ramble among stately oaks sparsely scattered over the even plain among which a horseman could
be seen at a great distance.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Behind the dunes were vast wet prairies and marshes, which, eastward and northward, gave way
to huge swamps of mixed hardwood forests. East of the windward shores, in the lee of the dunes and
beyond, the timbers closed up in spots into tighter savannas and cool forests of Sugar Maple and Beech;
but the timbers soon opened up again into scattered groves and prairies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the one hand stretched bur-oak plains, spread with a verdant carpet, variegated with dazzling wild
flowers, without an obstacle to intercept the view for miles, save the sombre trunks of the low oaks,
sparsely spreading their shadows across the lawn; on the other hand arose the undulations of the white
oak openings, with picturesque outlines of swales and slopes gracefully sweeping and sharply defined
in the distance. Then, there lay the majestic prairie, grand in expansive solitude, its fringe of timber,
as seen in the distance, resembling a diligently trained and well-trimmed garden parterre.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Southward and westward, the landscape was broken by large streams, with flat prairie bottoms and
scattered stretches of tree-lined bluffs and backwaters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The roads in this country are in a state of nature, But the ground is so smooth, and so entirely free
from stones, that when the earth is dry you do not find better roads at the north. &hellip; We took the
Galena road, forded the river, a stream about four rods wide, and passed on, over a beautiful, open
prairie country, here and there a log house, a small grove of timber, or small stream of water; the land
high, dry and rich, and arrived at night at Naper’s settlement, on the Du Page River, thirty-seven miles
from Chicago. &hellip; We now left the Galena road and took a course more northerly to the Big and Little
Woods, on [the] Fox River. In travelling twelve miles we came to the settiement, at the lower end of
&ldquo;Little Woods.” &hellip; houses were built near the timber, and a beautiful rich prairie opened before them.
&hellip; [The] Fox River is a clear stream of water, about twenty rods wide, having a hard limestone
bottom, from two to three feet deep, a brisk current, and generally fordable. On its banks, and on some
other streams, we occasionally found ledges of limestone; but other than that, we found no rocks in the
State. We here forded the river, and travelled all day on its western bank. We found less timber on
this side of the river. On the east side, it is generally lined with timber to the depth of a mile or more;
but the west side is scarcely skirted with it. It is somewhat singular and unaccountable, but we found
it universally to be the fact, that the east side of all the streams had much the largest portion of timber.<sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the streams in the northern parts of the state, which empty into the Wabash and Illinois, have
their branches interwoven with many of the rivers running into lake Erie and Michigan. &hellip; [T]hey not
unfrequently issue from the same marsh, prairie, pond, or lake. The &hellip; portage between the Chicago
and the Kickapoo [Des Plaines] branch of the Illinois, [is] rendered important by the inundations, which
at certain seasons cover the intermediate prairie, from which the two opposite streams flow. By this
means nature herself opened a navigable communication between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi;
and it is a fact, however difficult it may be of belief to many, that boats not unfrequently pass from
Lake Michigan into the Illinois, and in some instances without being subjected to the necessity of having
their lading taken out.<sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The country back of Chicago, for the distance of twelve miles, is a smooth, level prairie; producing an
abundance of grass, but too low and wet for cultivation. The Chicago River is formed by two branches,
which meet at the upper end of the village. The branches come from exactly opposite directions and
after running some distance, parallel with the lake, and about a mile from it, here meet each other, and
turning at right angles, flow in a regular straight channel, like a canal, into the lake. On each side of
the town, between these branches and the lake shore, there is, for some distance, a good growth of
wood and timber. On the lake shore, there are naked sand hills; and these are found all around the lake.
&hellip; If Lake Michigan were ten feet higher than its present level, its waters would flow into the Illinois
river. The Oplanes, a branch of the Illinois, approaches within twelve miles of the Lake; and the land
between is low and level. When the water is high, boats now pass from the lake to the river. At a time
of high water, a steamboat attempted to pass from the Illinois to the lake. After running a day from
Ottawa up the river, the water began to subside, the captain became alarmed, lest his boat might run
aground and returned.<sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The alluvial, or wet prairies, are generally on the margins of the great water courses, though sometimes
they are at a distance from them; their soil is deep, black, friable, and of exhaustless fertility. &hellip;
From May to October, the prairies are covered with tall grass and flower-producing weeds. In June and
July, they seem like an ocean of flowers of various hues, waving to the breezes which sweep over them.
The numerous tall flowering shrubs and vegetables which grow luxuriantly over these plains, present
a striking and delightful appearance.<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The landscape was replete with wet depressions, and, particularly northwestward in our region,
surrounded by copses of larch, and then by shrubs and sedge meadows. Such landscapes were burned on
a regular basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dry or undulating prairies are almost destitute of springs and of all vegetation, with the exception
of weeds, flowers, and grass. The undulations are so slight that, to the eye, the surface has almost the
appearance of an uninterrupted level, though the ravines made by freshets show that there is a
considerable degree of inclination. In the prairie region there are numerous ponds, formed some from
the surface water, the effect of rain, and the melting of the snows in the spring and others near the rivers
from their overflowing.<sup id="fnref2:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The prairies are all burnt over once a year, either in spring or fall, but generally in the fall; and the fire
is undoubtedly, the true cause of the origin and continuance of them. In passing through the State I saw
many of them on fire; and in the night, it was the grandest exhibition I ever saw. A mountain of flame,
30 feet high, and of unknown length, moving onward, roaring like &lsquo;many waters’&ndash;in a gently, stately
movement, and unbroken front&ndash;then impelled by a gust of wind, suddenly breaks itself to pieces, here
and there shooting ahead, whirling itself high in air&ndash;all becomes noise, and strife, and uproar, and
disorder. Well might Black Hawk look with indifference on the puny exhibition of fireworks in New
York, when he had so often seen fireworks displayed, on such a gigantic scale, on his own native
prairies.<sup id="fnref3:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For most writers today, our landscape no longer evokes such eloquence. To the extent that the
natural landscape is described at all, it is done so very clinically, mostly yielding codifications of plant
communities. Such taxonomies are facilitated by the fact that our natural communities are fragmented into
disparate pieces, with many of the intervening, and possibly confounding, communities gone forever.</p>
<p>Attempting to discriminate plant communities from among the myriad of plant associations is,
nonetheless, a pursuit of botanists seeking to assign each plant a &ldquo;proper” and definable place in the
landscape. Part of the challenge is to give each community a name which consists of two or three words
from the English dictionary. Commonly used words include nouns such as <em>forest</em>, <em>swamp</em>, <em>savanna</em>,
<em>flatwoods</em>, <em>prairie</em>, <em>meadow</em>, <em>fen</em>, and <em>bog</em>, and adjectives such as <em>acidic</em>, <em>alkaline</em>, <em>wet</em>, <em>mesic</em>, <em>dry</em>, <em>sandy</em>,
<em>mucky</em>, and <em>loamy</em>. The difficulty begins when the default assumption is made that if the words do not
exist, the community cannot exist. In the taxon entries we have avoided forcing the native species into
formally circumscribed plant communities, choosing instead to use common English prose and a list of
immediate associates to describe the habitat. While our native plants are prevailingly faithful to some
natural context, a disciplined attempt to place even a small percentage of the 1,638 elements into one or
more formally designated categories, however permutated, quickly informs the botanist of the folly of this
exercise.</p>
<p>Another factor complicating plant community classification is the fact that soon after the Native
American culture was replaced by the European culture changes in the human relationship with the
landscape caused fundamental changes in plant community composition. Cessation of fire, straightening
of rivers, ditching, tiling, heavy grazing, and urban and suburban infrastructure have so modified the
original structure and depauperized the land that our ability to piece together an understanding of natural
order is profoundly compromised. About 90 percent of our native flora is restricted to the stable habitats
provided by our original plant communities,<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> so an understanding and stewardship of such areas is
critical if we are to carry forward into the future a possibility of association with living things other than
ourselves, a few weeds, and cultivars.</p>
<p>Given all the problems associated with trying to envision and describe the natural plant
communities, we nevertheless will propose a paradigm of plant communities. While these communities
are certainly more artifacts of binary thinking than representative of nature, a brief synopsis can
communicate to a botanist information on the nature of our flora and landscape. An intellectual
miscarriage occurs only when it is pretended that such community constructs are or could be
&ldquo;scientifically&rdquo; abstracted.</p>
<p>Generally, one can visualize about nine principal kinds of communities: aquatic, marsh, fen, bog,
swamp, forest, savanna, dune, and prairie. With the exception of certain dune, bedrock, or coastal-plain
disjunct systems, most of these general community groups are variously expressed in the different natural
divisions and sections (see page 38). In choosing representative species, we have generally chosen a few
very conservative species to which the user can refer in the annotated checklist for further associates and
nuances of habit, distribution, and more detailed interpretations of the plant community. These
representative species are not intended to represent associations for specific kinds of plant communities;
rather, each species tends to represent a facet or variant of the general community type. The word
“characteristic,&rdquo; when used in connection with species listed under the community descriptions, does not
necessarily mean that the species are common or even locally extant in the community; rather, it is meant
to imply that the species are typical of or restricted to the community, and that habitat discussions under
those species in the annotated checklist amplify the character of the community. Another type of natural
community in the Chicago region is the ruderal flora, principally those species with <em>C</em> values 0 or 1.</p>
<h3 id="aquatic">Aquatic</h3>
<p>Aquatic plant communities were occasional throughout the region but most abundant in our eastern
and northwestern sectors. They formed in the landscape in potholes and in lacustrine plains where there
was no discharge. Since our region evaporates nearly or quite as much water as falls, aquatic communities
are sustained by waters from a surrounding watershed in excess of that provided by rain over their
surfaces. Generally, these excess waters filter down through vegetated ground into the underlying soil
until they reach impervious material, and exit by way of springs, rills, or ground water. Along our major
streams, aquatic plant communities developed in alluvial sloughs and ponds derived from surface melt or
runoff waters.</p>
<p>The more minerotrophic or ground-water communities are characterized by plants such as Brasenia
schreberi, Hippuris vulgaris, Megalodonta beckii, Myriophyllum verticillatum pectinatum, Potamogeton
amplifolius, Potamogeton richardsonii, Potamogeton strictifolius, Utricularia vulgaris, and Zannichellia
palustris. In softer waters one is more likely to encounter plants such as Nuphar advena, Nuphar
variegatum, Nymphaea tuberosa, Utricularia geminiscapa, and Utricularia purpurea. Alluvial or surface
water communities are characterized by members of the Lemnaceae, Ceratophyllum demersum,
Potamogeton foliosus, Potamogeton pectinatus, Potamogeton illinoensis, and Potamogeton natans.</p>
<h3 id="marsh">Marsh</h3>
<p>Marsh plant communities generally occur along the transition between aquatic communities and
drier communities, or in large flats which are regularly inundated by shallow surface waters for much of the growing season. Marshes are best developed with us in the Lake Plain, in the lacustrine flats of our
northwestern and eastern sectors, and along the lower reaches of the Des Plaines and Kankakee river drainages. These communities are best characterized by emergent species such as <em>Carex aquatilis</em>, <em>Carex
lacustris</em>, <em>Hydrocotyle umbellata</em>, <em>Hypericum boreale</em>, <em>Peltandra virginica</em>, <em>Pontederia cordata</em>, <em>Sagittaria
graminea</em>, <em>Sagittaria latifolia</em>, <em>Sagittaria rigida</em>, <em>Scirpus subterminalis</em>, <em>Scirpus validus creber</em>, <em>Sparganium
americanum</em>, <em>Sparganium chlorocarpum</em>, <em>Sparganium eurycarpum</em>, and <em>Zizania aquatica</em>. On the shores
of ponds, lakes, and swales, often growing without heavy competition, conservative species include
<em>Cyperus diandrus</em>, <em>Eleocharis geniculata</em>, <em>Juncus pelocarpus</em>, <em>Peplis diandra</em>, <em>Rotala ramosior</em>, <em>Scirpus
purshianus</em>, <em>Scirpus torreyi</em>, <em>Sparganium chlorocarpum</em>, <em>Utricularia gibba</em>, <em>Veronica comosa</em>, and <em>Veronica
scutellata</em>. A related community, with affinities to fens and wet prairies, is the sedge meadow. It
develops in large, shallow, lacustrine flats, and is dominated by hummocks of sedges, particularly <em>Carex
stricta</em>, and characterized by conservative species such as <em>Aster puniceus</em>, <em>Carex buxbaumii</em>, <em>Carex
atriculata</em>, <em>Dulichium arundinaceum</em>, <em>Lysimachia terrestris</em>, <em>Lysimachia thyrsiflora</em>, <em>Rumex orbiculatus</em>,
<em>Sium suave</em>, and <em>Utricularia vulgaris</em>.</p>
<h3 id="fen">Fen</h3>
<p>Fens are wetland communities which occur in areas where the glacial formations are such that
carbonate-rich ground water discharges at a constant rate along the slopes of kames, eskers, moraines,
river bluffs, or even dunes, or in flats associated with these formations, provided the material through
which the waters traveled is rich in calcium or magnesium carbonates. Depending upon the circumstances
fens can occur where marl is at or near the surface or where peats are constantly bathed in minerotrophic
ground water; such areas can be wooded or open.</p>
<p>Marly fens are commonly on open prairie slopes and are characterized by <em>Carex sterilis</em>, <em>Eleocharis
rostellata</em>, <em>Rhynchospora capillacea</em>, <em>Scirpus cespitosus callosus</em>, <em>Tofieldia glutinosa</em>, and <em>Triglochin
palustris</em>. In the constantly flowing rills discharging in these fens grow <em>Agrostis alba palustris</em>, <em>Armoracia
aquatica</em>, <em>Berula erecta</em>, and <em>Mimulus glabratus fremontii</em>. Related to the hillside fens are the wooded
seeps which occur sporadically on steep bluffs. Characteristic species include <em>Aster prenanthoides</em>,
<em>Cimicifuga racemosa</em>, <em>Fraxinus nigra</em>, <em>Polymnia canadensis</em>, <em>Rhamnus alnifolia</em>, <em>Rhamnus lanceolata</em>,
<em>Thuja occidentalis</em>, <em>Ulmus thomasii</em>, and <em>Veronica americana</em>. As fens become peatier characteristic
species include Betula pumila, Campanula uliginosa, Conioselinum chinense, Eriophorum angustifolium,
Filipendula rubra, Galium asprellum, Habenaria lacera, Phlox maculata, Pogonia ophioglossoides,
Patentilla fruticosa, Salix candida, Saxifraga pensylvanica, Solidago uliginosa, and Valeriana uliginosa.
The flat, black-soil prairie fens are characterized by Aster borealis, Carex interior, Carex prairea, Cirsium
muticum, Cypripedium candidum, Habenaria hyperborea huronensis, Lobelia kalmii, Muhlenbergia
glamerata, Parnassia glauca, Satureja arkansana, Scleria verticillata, Selaginella apoda, and Valeriana ciliata.</p>
<h3 id="bog">Bog</h3>
<p>Bog, like most of the other terms used here to describe plant communities, is not a scientific word
in the sense that its use always signifies a uniform, unique concept which is standardly perceived. Any
place, for example, where there is a quagmire or wet, mucky, hummocky ground is likely to be termed
a &ldquo;bog;&rdquo; hence, the expression &ldquo;bogged down.&rdquo; The contemporary ecologist tends to restrict the term
&ldquo;bog&rdquo; to a hydric/edaphic vegetational scenario which is typified by acidic, usually organic substrates, and
a characteristic floristic composition. Many of our peatlands are influenced significantly by waters rich
in carbonates and can be called prairie fens. But as the cation exchange capacity damps off bog-like
conditions can begin to develop. Many of the bogs in our northwestern sector can be called alkaline bogs
for that reason.</p>
<p>Commonly the peatland floats on a minerotrophic head of water, with the deeper roots thus exposed
to calcareous or circumneutral conditions, and the shallower roots are imbedded in the upper sphagnum
mat, probably in a more acidic environment. Characteristic species in these minerotrophic or alkaline bogs
include Carex brunnescens, Carex diandra, Carex lasiocarpa americana, Carex leptalea, Geum rivale,
Hypericum virginicum fraseri, Larix laricina, Menyanthes trifoliata minor, Potentilla palustris, Rhus
vernix, Rhynchospora alba, Ribes hirtellum, Salix pedicellaris hypoglauca, Salix serissima, Sarracenia
purpurea, Utricularia intermedia, and Utricularia minor. In large basins or in areas where the influence
of minerotrophic waters is insignificant, characteristically acid bogs can develop, inhabited by plants such
as Andromeda glaucophylla, Arethusa bulbosa, Carex atlantica capillacea, Carex canescens, Carex
chordorrhiza, Carex disperma, Carex echinata, Carex limosa, Carex oligosperma, Carex pauciflora, Carex
tenuiflora, Carex trisperma, Chamaedaphne calyculata angustifolia, Cypripedium acaule, Drosera
intermedia, Drosera rotundifolia, Eriophorum gracile, Eriophorum spissum, Eriophorum virginicum,
Habenaria blephariglottis, Habenaria ciliaris, Hypericum virginicum, Salix sericea, Scheuchzeria palustris
americana, Utricularia geminiscapa, Vaccinium macrocarpon, Vaccinium oxycoccos, Viola pallens, and
Woodwardia virginica. Related to the acid bog, often in sand flats or basins, are floating sedge mats that
rise and fall with the water table. Such mats are characterized by Eleocharis robbinsii, Eriocaulon
septangulare, Fuirena pumila, Hypericum canadense, Rhexia virginica, and Scirpus smithii.</p>
<h3 id="swamp">Swamp</h3>
<p>Swamps are wetlands characterized by trees growing in large flats or basins that are poorly drained,
with most of the water leaving through evapotranspiration. They can occur in the backwaters of large,
slow moving rivers, such as the Kankakee, or in wet sandy flats in the Kankakee Sand Section south of
the Valparaiso Moraine. They also occur on the moraine in wet depressions. North of the Valparaiso
Moraine, in the Lake Plain, they are best developed in the large flats behind the high dunes.</p>
<p>Along the Kankakee River they occur in bottomlands, with characteristic species including Carex
typhina, Cephalanthus occidentalis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica subintegerrima, Fraxinus tomentosa, Mikania
scandens, Populus heterophylla, and Styrax americana. In sandy, poorly drained flats with a high water
table, a fire-dependent savanna-like swamp dominated by Quercus palustris is characterized by Bartonia
virginica, Betula nigra, Carex haydenii, Carex longii, Carex straminea, Eleocharis tenuis verrucosa, and
Rubus hispidus. On the moraines, especially the Valparaiso and Lake Border moraines, there are shallow
depressions characterized by Quercus bicolor; other characteristic species include Carex crus-corvi, Carex
lupuliformis, Carex muskingumensis, Carex squarrosa, Carex tuckermanii, Carex vesicaria monile,
Cephalanthus occidentalis, Fraxinus nigra, Onoclea sensibilis, and Lycopus rubellus. There is a phase
of this swamp on the low terraces of the Kankakee River, characterized by Carex grayii, Carex lupulina,
Carex muskingumensis, Leersia lenticularis, Lysimachia hybrida, and Quercus bicolor.</p>
<p>In the broad low flats behind the high dunesof Lake Michigan lies one of the richest and most
complicated forested systems in our region. It is characterized by a complex hydrology and is interspersed
by gentle rises, shallow depressions, and hummocks, and consists of an inseparable mixture of wooded
fen, bog, and mesic forest. It supports a wide array of species, including trees such as Acer saccharum,
Betula alleghaniensis, Betula papyrifera, Fagus grandifolia, Quercus bicolor, Quercus palustris, Quercus
rubra, and Tilia americana; other characteristic species include Carex bromoides, Carex crinita, Carex
debilis rudgei, Carex folliculata, Carex intumescens, Carex seorsa, Chrysosplenium americanum, Coptis
trifolia, Cypripedium calceolus pubescens, Dryopteris cristata, Habenaria clavellata, Habenaria flava
herbiola, Habenaria psycodes, Lycopodium lucidulum, Lycopodium obscurum, Medeola virginiana, Milium
effusum, Nemopanthus mucronata, Poa paludigena, Rubus pubescens, Trientalis borealis, and Viola
incognita. Such swamps, while they retain their essential characteristics, change in specific species
zomposition as one travels northeastward from Dune Acres in Porter County to Benton Harbor in Berrien County</p>
<h3 id="forest">Forest</h3>
<p>Forests occur in our eastern sector on rises which are relatively well drained and physiographically
located such that exposure to fire is rare. Such forests are dominated by Acer saccharum and Fagus
grandifolia. The ground cover vegetation is not physiognomically capable of sustaining a line of fire.
Characteristic species include Athyrium pycnocarpon, Athyrium thelypterioides, Carex amphibola, Carex
careyana, Carex deweyana, Carex digitalis, Carex laxiflora, Carex leptonervia, Carex plantaginea, Carex
prasina, Corallorhiza maculata, Cornus rugosa, Dentaria diphylla, Dicentra canadensis, Dirca palustris,
Dryopteris hexagonoptera, Dryopteris marginalis, Dryopteris noveboracensis, Galium circaezans, Galium
lanceolatum, Hieracium paniculatum, Hydrophyllum canadense, Lonicera canadensis, Maianthemum
canadense, Mitella diphylla, Panax trifolius, Panicum commutatum ashei, Panicum dichotomum, Poa
alsodes, Pyrola asarifolia purpurea, Sambucus pubens, Tipularia discolor, and Viola rostrata. Another
type of forest is along the high dunes, northward in Berrien County, characterized by Betula alleghaniensis, Cornus rugosa, Dirca palustris, Fagus grandifolia, Taxus canadensis, and Tsuga canadensis.</p>
<p>A relative of our eastern forest occurs on the western bluff of Lake Michigan in the deep morainic
dissections or ravines. Here also grow Acer saccharum and Fagus grandifolia, but the ground cover
vegetation is such that sporadic ground fires could creep down the slopes from the savannas on the higher,
more level ground, and nose slopes. Characteristic species include Betula papyrifera, Carex pedunculata,
Dryopteris filix-mas, Matteuccia struthiopteris, Poa languida, Populus balsamifera, Prunus nigra, Pyrola
elliptica, and Shepherdia canadensis. Pinus resinosa may also have grown here.</p>
<h3 id="savanna">Savanna</h3>
<p>Savannas, as interpreted here, include those portions of our wooded landscape in which structure
was, to one degree or another, affected by fires set by Native Americans in the thousands of years before
European settlement. Generally, these communities were intercalated among the prairies and developed
a ground-cover vegetation which would carry at least occasional fires in the autumn, when their
surrounding prairies were wont to burn. Such savannas ranged in character from completely closed and
forest-like, to very open with only scattered trees.</p>
<p>Most related to the forest communities are mesic savannas. These are closed-canopy woodlands,
dominated by Acer nigrum and Quercus rubra, and with a graminoid ground cover capable of sustaining
small but occasional ground fires. Such savannas are best developed on north- and east-facing slopes in
dissected or topographically complex portions of the moraines. Characteristic species include Actaea
rubra, Adiantum pedatum, Agrimonia rostellata, Arabis canadensis, Aralia racemosa, Aristolochia
serpentaria, Aster furcatus, Aureolaria virginica, Brachyelytrum erectum, Carex gracillima, Carex
hitchcockiana, Carex laxiculmis, Carex shortiana, Carex woodii, Cercis canadensis, Collinsia verna,
Conopholis americana, Diarrhena americana, Dryopteris goldiana, Habenaria viridis bracteata,
Jeffersonia diphylla, Linum virginianum, Lonicera dioica, Morus rubra, Muhlenbergia sylvatica, Orchis
spectabilis, Poa sylvestris, Sanicula trifoliata, Scutellaria ovata versicolor, and Trillium grandifiorum.</p>
<p>On the more undulating, well drained, but fertile morainic ridges and knolls are the dry-mesic
savannas dominated by Quercus alba and Quercus macrocarpa. It is probable that portions of such
woodlands burned fairly regularly, and carried low but steady lines of flame. Characteristic species
include Agalinis gattingeri, Arenaria lateriflora, Aster schreberi, Bromus purgans, Camassia scilloides,
Carex hirtifolia, Carex oligocarpa, Carex pensylvanica, Carya ovata, Corylus americana, Dodecatheon
meadia, Erigeron pulchellus, Eupatorium sessilifolium brittonianum, Helianthemum bicknellii, Heuchera
richardsonii, Hystrix patula, Krigia biflora, Lathyrus ochroleucus, Lechea intermedia, Monotropa uniflora,
Orobanche uniflora, Silene virginica, Swertia caroliniensis, Taenidia integerrima, Trillium sessile, and
Vici caroliniana.</p>
<p>On the nearly level or gently undulating moraines are the open savannas of heavier soil
characterized by open-grown trees of Quercus macrocarpa. Such savannas have a well developed
graminoid ground cover, and carry substantial fires on a regular basis. These savannas developed on low
mounds within the mesic or wet prairies, or in transitional zones between the lower prairies and the dry
prairies of kames and eskers. Little is known about the conservative flora of these savannas, but species
which we associate with the Bur Oak include Andropogon gerardii, Carex pensylvanica, Carya ovata,
Corylus americana, Galium concinnum, Helianthus hirsutus, Hypoxis hirsuta, Lilium michiganense, Rosa
setigera, Solidago juncea, Thalictrum dasycarpum, Trillium recurvatum, and Veronicastrum virginicum.</p>
<p>In sandy soils, especially in our eastern sector, along well drained ridges and old dunes, the
savannas are dominated by Quercus velutina. Such savannas are closely associated with sand prairies, and
the two communities have many species in common. The sand savannas burn regularly and are
characterized by species such as Aralia hispida, Aster linariifolius, Baptisia tinctoria crebra, Campanula
rotundifolia, Carex siccata, Chimaphila umbellata cisatlantica, Corydalis sempervirens, Galium pilosum,
Liatris aspera, Lysimachia quadrifolia, Monotropa hypopithys, Pteridium aquilinum latiusculum, Rubus
enslenii, Spiranthes lacera, and Vaccinium angustifolium.</p>
<p>It would seem that there is a close association between the sand savannas and what once were pine
savannas near the southern shore of Lake Michigan, where Pinus strobus was plentiful along the dunes.
There remain a few isolated stands where one can only imagine what species once characterized these pine
savannas. It was probably in these pine savannas wherein resided such now rare plants as Arctostaphylos
uva-ursi coactilis, Epigaea repens, Habenaria hookeri, Lactuca hirsuta, Melampyrum lineare latifolium,
Oryzopsis pungens, and Polygala paucifolia. Probably also included here are the associates of Carex
eburnea, Celtis tenuifolia, Chimaphila maculata, Juniperus communis, Oryzopsis asperifolia, and Pyrola
rotundifolia americana. Farther north, along the high dunes, the pine savannas give way to a wooded
dune forest.</p>
<h3 id="dune">Dune</h3>
<p>On the open sand of foredunes of Lake Michigan is a special habitat characterized by species which
grow locally only in the dunes near the lake. These include Ammophila breviligulata, Cakile edentula,
Cirsium pitcheri, Euphorbia polygonifolia, Lathyrus japonicus glaber, Salix syrticola, and Solidago
racemosa gillmanii. Confined to the lower dunes along the western shore of Lake Michigan is Juniperus
horizontalis. In the more active sands in the dunes of our eastern sector grow Hudsonia tomentosa,
Polygonella articulata, and Selaginella rupestris.</p>
<p>In wet, interdunal flats (pannes), where sand has been blown out down to the water table, is a plant
community generally characterized by species such as Carex aurea, Carex garberi, Gentiana crinita,
Hypericum kalmianum, Sabatia angularis, Triglochin maritima, and Utricularia cornuta. The pannes near
Ogden Dunes, Porter County, are characteristically surrounded by small forests of Pinus banksiana.
Related to both the pannes and the prairie fens is a kind of wet alkaline prairie, characterized by plants
such as Agalinis skinneriana, Carex conoidea, Carex crawei, Carex flava, Carex viridula, Castilleja
coccinea, Cladium mariscoides, Cypripedium calceolus parviflorum, Eleocharis compressa, Panicum
boreale, and Scleria triglomerata.</p>
<h3 id="prairie">Prairie</h3>
<p>The prairies comprise those plant communities that are dominated by a diversity of perennial forbs
growing in a perennial graminoid matrix, which forms a dry flammable turf in autumn. A part of the
habitat of our prairies was the regular autumnal fire, which, lacking a regular occurrence of dry lightning,
was set annually by the Native Americans. Prairies developed on those substrates in which the aboveground perennial phytomass produced more fixed carbon annually than was likely to be grazed or
decomposed. In our area prairie communities range from wet to dry and once dominated much of the
landscape, intercalating or even blending with savannas and fens.</p>
<p>To a Midwesterner, perhaps the first image evoked with the term prairie is that of the tall grasses
of Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans in their full, late-summer development&ndash;&ldquo;high as a man
on a horse,&rdquo; interspersed with the rosinweeds, sunflowers, and asters. Such are the mesic prairies;
conservative species within them include Baptisia leucophaea, Cacalia plantaginea, Carex bicknellii,
Eryngium yuccifolium, Gentiana andrewsii, Gentiana puberulenta, Habenaria leucophaea, Lilium
philadelphicum andinum, Panicum leibergii, Sisyrinchium albidum, and Sporobolus heterolepis. A wetter
variant of the mesic prairie is more likely to be dominated by Calamagrostis canadensis and Spartina
pectinata, with Aster puniceus firmus, Beckmannia syzigachne, Chelone glabra, Eleocharis wolfii,
Lysimachia quadriflora, Oenothera perennis, Oenothera pilosella, Pedicularis lanceolata, and Solidago
ohioensis, and in its best development is fen-like.</p>
<p>In the drier prairies Andropogon scoparius and Stipa spartea are commonly the more obvious
grasses, with conservative species including Agalinis aspera, Asclepias viridiflora, Aster ptarmicoides,
Aster sericeus, Astragalus tennesseensis, Blephilia ciliata, Bromus kalmii, Carex meadii, Cirsium hillii,
Convolvulus spithamaeus, Helianthus occidentalis, Panicum perlongum, Polytaenia nuttallii, Psoralea
tenuifoa and Zizia aptera. Another kind of dry prairie occurs in the Kettle Moraine Section, or our
northwestern sector and, growing among short warm-season grasses like Bouteloua curtipendula,
characteristic species include Agoseris cuspidata, Allium stellatum, Anemone patens wolfgangiana,
Artemisia serrata, Asclepias lanuginosa, Blephilia ciliata, Carex richardsonii, Geum triflorum, Houstonia
longifolia, Oenothera serrulata, Panicum wilcoxianum, Potentilla pensylvanica bipinnatifida, Ranunculus
rhomboideus, Sisyrinchium campestre, and Wulfenia bullii. Another variant of the dry prairie occurs on
the dolomitic bedrock pavements exposed along our major rivers, particularly the lower Des Plaines;
characteristic species are Actinea herbacea, Arenaria patula, Deschampsia caespitosa glauca,
Muhlenbergia cuspidata, Petalostemum foliosum, and Scutellaria parvula.</p>
<p>A major variant of the dry prairie is the sand prairie, in which the principal fuel species is
commonly Andropogon scoparius; in many respects it seems scarcely more than an exaggerated opening
in the sand savanna. Characteristic species include Asclepias hirtella, Astragalus canadensis, Callirhoé
triangulata, Carex muhlenbergii, Ceanothus herbaceus, Commelina erecta deamiana, Desmodium ciliare,
Fimbristylis puberula, Orobanche fasciculata, and Sisyrinchium montanum. In moist to wet, acid sandy
flts occurs an array of conservative species, many of them with affinities to the Coastal Plain. Such flats
occur here and there throughout our southern and eastern sectors, off the moraines in the Lake Plain and
in the Kankakee Sand Sections. Each such area has its own distinctive flora; characteristic conservative
species in the aggregate include Aletris farinosa, Buchnera americana, Calopogon tuberosus, Carex alata,
Carex atlantica, Cyperus dentatus, Eleocharis melanocarpa, Eleocharis microcarpa filiculmis, Hypericum
adpressum, Hypericum canadense, Hypericum gymnanthum, Juncus biflorus, Juncus nodatus, Linum intercursum, Linum striatum, Ludwigia sphaerocarpa deamii, Lycopodium inundatum, Lycopus amplectens,
Panicum polyanthes, Panicum verrucosum, Polygala cruciata aquilonia, Psilocarya scirpoides,
Rhynchospora globularis recognita, Rhynchospora macrostachya, Rubus setosus, Salix lucida, Scirpus
hallii, Scleria pauciflora caroliniana, Utricularia subulata, Viola primulifolia, Xyris difformis, and Xyris
torta.</p>
<h3 id="ruderal-areas">Ruderal Areas</h3>
<p>It is presumed that many of our non-conservative native species developed their &ldquo;weedy&rdquo; tendencies
in connection with the Native American peoples, particular those who were sedentary and agricultural.

compaction, or to very fertile soils free of conservative competition. In the drier soils such species include

Salix interior, Sambucus canadensis, Typha angustifolia, and Typha latifolia.</p>
<h3 id="bireal-and-coastal-plain">Bireal and Coastal Plain</h3>
<p>An interesting aspect of the Chicago region is its position at the southern end of Lake Michigan
with its Lake Plain flora, coupled with the large sand district associated with the Kankakee River.
Together these singular areas have provided a remarkable context for habitats that support species
otherwise more common northward or with their principal range in the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Many of
these plants and their habitats, especially those which occur in the Indiana dune region, are discussed at
length by Wilhelm.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
