<aside>Retracing the old road north of Mexico City.</aside>
<p rel="author">by Rachel Louise Snyder</p>
<hr>

<p>I scramble gleefully up a concrete incline six feet above the
cobblestone road, but Hal Jackson saunters. We stand in the ruins of
what was once a large house, twenty minutes outside Zacatecas, Mexico. The
air is cool. Scrubby mountains pocked with old silver mines sweep across
the landscape. Jackson is uneasy. I collect several pebbles, fallen
pieces of wall. Jackson shakes his head, wanders the brush. &ldquo;This is
disappointing,&rdquo; he says, eyes scanning, GPS in one hand, notepad in the
other, camera slung round his neck. <i>Why?</i> &ldquo;It just seems&hellip;&rdquo; he trails
off, gingerly steps over a sharp rock embedded in the earth. He was once
a marathoner, and though it&rsquo;s been thirteen years since his last, he maintains
a runner&rsquo;s lean grace. At seventy he looks perhaps fifty-five. &ldquo;I thought it&rsquo;d be
bigger,&rdquo; he mutters. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t seem right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are in Pánuco, the birthplace of Juan de Oñate, the last of the
Spanish conquistadors, whose hand likely had more influence on the
American Southwest and northern Mexico than that of any other single
explorer. In 1598, Oñate blazed the <i xml:lang="es">Camino Real de Tierra Adentro</i>, a
trail that became the most used and most significant route of commerce
and culture for three hundred years. At its peak the Camino Real ran 1,800 miles
from Mexico City north to Santa Fe. Spaniards used the trail to settle
towns and villages all along the way, Franciscans used it to spread
their gospel, troops from the United States and Mexico used it for
waging battles and building forts, Indians used it to fight the swelling
tide of foreigners, and traders used it for commerce. All morning,
Jackson and I have searched for the remains of the Oñate family
hacienda, and now, with the Jeep Cherokee parked conspicuously on the
narrow road, clouds in full bloom beyond the mountains, and my pocket
full of pebbles, Jackson&rsquo;s doubt continues to deepen.</p>
<p>A man in stained white jeans and a thinning white undershirt wanders
down the road below us in sandals. He greets the two gringos standing
atop a ruined wall in a pool of packed dirt bursting with purple
wildflowers. Jackson tells him we want Oñate&rsquo;s villa; the man looks
bemused, then beckons us down from our perch.</p>
<p>A quarter-mile up and three minutes later we find the hacienda for real:
an enormous hillock of pink cobblestones with a wall running around the
circumference, a turret in the middle, the remnants of an ancient pool,
a burrowed garden. The place is grand and empty. Silent with a cool
breeze. It bears not a single marker indicating what it once was or who
lived here. We three wander about it. Now Jackson is gleeful, running to
take pictures, climbing up on the walls to peer at the vistas, his dusty
white baseball hat nearly flying off behind him. &ldquo;Now this”⁠—he grins,
index finger poised in the air⁠—“this is what I pictured.
<em>This&hellip;is&hellip;it!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Throughout New Mexico and Texas, Oñate&rsquo;s trail is clearly marked, but in
Mexico many parts of it remained unknown to modern explorers, and
Jackson and I set out on a mission to find them. We carried minutely
detailed topographical maps and aerial maps from the early twentieth
century, which often showed a trail obvious from a bird&rsquo;s-eye view but
elusive on the ground. We also carried copies of travelers&rsquo; journals
that contained specific descriptions of the natural landscape, of
mountains and valleys that wouldn&rsquo;t have changed much, and of rest areas
for caravans that still bore names Oñate had given them. Thus we had a
decent idea of where things should have been if they hadn&rsquo;t been paved
or farmed over. &ldquo;Trail finding,&rdquo; Jackson assured me, &ldquo;can be an exact
science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certain facts held true about the trail regardless of any particular
location. For example, it always ran above the flood-plain. Also, water
was a constant concern, so the caravans went for a route where it was
accessible and where attacks by hostile Apache or Comanche Indians came
infrequently. <i xml:lang="es">Acequias</i>⁠—irrigation ditches⁠—often paralleled the
trail, and they do even today in pueblos and small towns where they are
still used. Oñate&rsquo;s hacienda marked the final discovery of our journey,
and the apex above all the others. Without Oñate, the trail might never
have existed. Without Oñate, geographical boundaries, language, culture,
battles, history, food, family, ethnic and racial intersection,
economics, trade, and travel would have been vastly different. Without
Oñate, Jackson and I⁠—a generation and 1,500 miles apart from each
other⁠—would have never met four hundred years later.</p>
<p>Our fortuitous guide explained what each walled section might have
represented in Oñate&rsquo;s day. He showed us how to climb over trees, and
through holes in the walls where vegetation had overgrown the pathways;
he pointed out where the aqueduct ran in from the mountains. Hal took
measurements, notes, and pictures; he clicked his GPS. We climbed
halfway up a mountain for an eagle&rsquo;s-eye view. Were this hacienda in the
United States, historical preservation societies would have tagged,
ticketed, and renovated it; it would not be inhabited by local fauna and
ignored by humans. This was the home of a man who changed the course of
history. For Jackson and me, it marked the end of a long journey, but
for Juan de Oñate and his Camino Real, this place was just the
beginning.</p>
<p>Built originally by the Spanish Empire to connect capital cities to one
another, <i xml:lang="es">camino reals</i>, or royal roads, snaked throughout what is now the
Western United States and Mexico. But there is only one <i xml:lang="es">Camino Real de
Tierra Adentro</i>, the one Jackson and I drove; in addition to its
incredible length, it predates the other <i xml:lang="es">camino reals</i> by more than two hundred
years, according to George Torok, president of the Camino Real de Tierra
Adentro (CARTA) association.</p>
<p>Beyond simply offering a way to get around, the Camino Real became a
palimpsest of cultural, religious, economic, and ethnic crossovers.
Skirmishes, business deals, wars, and treaties were wrought along its
path. Like the old Route 66 of the United States, it was as much a
cultural symbol as a practical method of travel. Unlike America&rsquo;s
modern-day expressways, which mostly skirt cities and often divide
ethnicities and races from one neighborhood to the next, Oñate&rsquo;s Camino
Real, our country&rsquo;s first superhighway, brought states, countries, and
people together.</p>
<p>Because of it, Indians went from &ldquo;hunting grubs to being warriors of the
Plains in a single generation after the introduction of the horse,&rdquo;
Jackson says; he calls the animal a &ldquo;technological revolution.&rdquo; Mission
churches replaced <i xml:lang="hop">kivas</i> as community centers, and villages began to
gather around central squares. Catholicism flourished. Crops like corn,
beans, and squash were introduced. The English and Spanish tongues
mingled and eventually overwhelmed pueblo languages. Even food
preparation changed, as the Spaniards taught Mexican Indians the concept
of frying. Chickens, pigs, sheep, and goats arrived, along with new
forms of architecture, new diseases, and new kinds of enslavement by the
Spaniards. &ldquo;There is constant traffic where the trail went up from
Mexico,&rdquo; Torok told me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still happening today: the migration, the
immigration, the influence. It wasn&rsquo;t a finite time period.&rdquo; The Camino Real
grew into a cultural system inscribed on the land itself. As we
move forward in the present, it seems to say, we are bound to the past.</p>
<p>Its history can be loosely divided into six periods: 1598⁠–⁠1680, when
Oñate and his successors connected the paths that led from village to
village into what we recognize as the Camino Real today; 1680⁠–⁠93, when
the Pueblo Indians revolted against the invasion of their culture and
expelled the Spaniards from northern territories for thirteen years;
1693⁠–⁠1821, with the Spaniards back again and the Camino Real once more
a thoroughfare for commerce, culture, and war; 1821⁠–⁠80, when Mexico
gained its independence and Americans were allowed to trade; followed by
the Mexican War of 1846⁠–⁠48, which made the northern stretch of the
<i xml:lang="es">Camino Real</i> American; and finally, the 1880s when the rails replaced the
road. A few paved parts of the Camino Real are still used unchanged
today in pueblos and small towns, but for a purist like Jackson, the
trail&rsquo;s great days are gone.</p>
<p>Jackson and I began our tour in early July, just about the worst time to
do a lot of driving through the desert. Having retired as a professor
from Humblodt State University, Jackson now spends his days on the
trail. He serves as president of the Santa Fe Trail Association, and he
wrote the revised version of Marc Simmons&rsquo;s <i>Following the Santa Fe
Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers</i>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Last May, he helped form
the Camino Real Trail Association, and he&rsquo;s now writing a guidebook
about that trail, to be published this June by the University of New
Mexico Press. He has been a political geographer, and he wrote his
dissertation on a squatters&rsquo; village outside Mexico City, so his idea of
place is inextricably linked to people and policy. He&rsquo;s a diehard
liberal, but his biggest complaint about archeologists, anthropologists,
and sociologists⁠—all of whose subjects overlap with cultural
geography⁠—is that they just don&rsquo;t make good maps.</p>
<p>To say that Jackson is a map man is like saying that astronauts enjoy
air travel. He doesn&rsquo;t just <em>like</em> maps; he lives by them. He keeps
topographical and aerial maps organized by route in a box in the back
seat of his car, next to atlases, road maps, Lonely Planet maps, and
historical maps. In his home office, he has maps framed on the walls,
maps in filing cabinets, and maps laid out over his desk. Each morning
after breakfast, maps cover his dining room table. He has computer
programs to make maps. At various points during our journey, he offered
to make me maps including or excluding such features as power lines,
bodies of water, villages, and mountains. He doesn&rsquo;t like to be lost. He
told me once that he figured he looked at maps a hundred times a day.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the where guy,&rdquo; he says. He respects maps, and they in turn have
given him the assurance of one who always knows his place in the world.</p>
<p>Our route began north of Santa Fe in the San Juan Pueblo, which Oñate
occupied in July of 1598. Large excavations have been done in this area,
so the location of the original mission church and central square are
denoted by a marker, in the midst of a field of chamise and juniper
beside a graveyard. &ldquo;In northern New Mexico, there&rsquo;s still a lot of
resentment today toward Oñate, whose soldiers were said to be savage,&rdquo;
Jackson said. He illustrated this with a story about the Acoma Pueblo
just outside Albuquerque. The tale claims that the Indians were living
peacefully when Oñate&rsquo;s men descended on them, and chopped off the right
foot of every man over sixteen. As the Spanish tell it, the Acomas attacked
the Spaniards first, and the latter were merely retaliating. Several
years ago, on the eve of the opening of a new Oñate museum, north of the
San Juan Pueblo along the road to Taos, someone chopped off the right
foot of Oñate&rsquo;s statue.</p>
<p>With close to five hundred people following him, Oñate, whose soldiers often
marched in full body armor through the desert heat, averaged fifteen miles a
day. Jackson and I covered fifteen times that. Remarkably, Oñate managed to
establish the first American thoroughfare, predating the colony of
Jamestown, yet has never received much historical credit. The author
Marc Simmons, who wrote of Oñate&rsquo;s perilous journey in <em>The Last
Conquistador</em>, said that along with everything else the conquistador did
to establish the shape and character of North America, he also &ldquo;made a
notable contribution, through his wide-ranging explorations, toward an
understanding of the true geography of western America.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Just ten miles outside Santa Fe, Jackson showed me my first swale, a
carved-out bowl of earth, where deep cuts from wagon wheels could still
be detected. &ldquo;I get excited about swales,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;but not everyone
does. Standing where something happened is very powerful to me.&rdquo; In the
distance La Majada Mesa loomed black and foreboding. In Oñate&rsquo;s time, the
mesa was a near-insurmountable challenge to cross. Wagons had to be
emptied, and their goods carried steeply uphill on horseback while the
carts were routed through the shallow river that cleaved the mesa.
Loaded with their cargoes, the carts would have been mired in the
riverbed. In <em>Commerce of the Prairies</em>, perhaps the best traveler&rsquo;s
account of the Camino Real, Josiah Gregg, a mid-nineteenth-century
trader, wrote of the treacherous crossings: &ldquo;In some places, if a wagon
is permitted to stop in the river but for a moment, it sinks to the very
body <i xml:lang="la">[sic]</i>. Instances have occurred when it became necessary, not only to drag
out the mules by the ears and to carry out the loading package by
package, but to haul out the wagon piece by piece⁠—wheel by wheel.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>We drove to the base of La Majada Mesa, parked in the dust, and got out
to walk along the old trail. &ldquo;Look at this.&rdquo; Jackson shook his head,
pointed to where the trail had created an obvious swale, then
disappeared from view &lsquo;round the bend of the mountain. Jackson believed
few people even noticed the mountain. &ldquo;Ten miles outside Santa Fe and
not a single footprint,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>As we drove, the terra-cotta countryside gave way to rich, red clay
hills and low cliffs, and I began to learn how to read a landscape.
Jackson pointed out that curved roads in a grid city, for example, were
very likely just old trails paved over. The entire city of Boston is the
most famous example of this. Parts of the Camino Real that are paved
prove the fact. &ldquo;The caravans took the best route, not necessarily
north, east, south, and west,&rdquo; Jackson told me, as we drove trail areas
near his home in Placitas, New Mexico, just outside Albuquerque. &ldquo;A
crooked street in a city laid out by <i xml:lang="es">gringos</i>?
You can be sure it predates the grid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flat plain, carved-out swales often collected rainwater and runoff,
so a long row of green bushes in a mostly barren landscape might mean
the trail had run through there. Or a straight cut through a lush green
area might signal the trail&rsquo;s presence. Jackson was a landscape
detective alert for clues. An oddly shaped mountain had been mined; a
mound of dirt was a melted adobe house; a shallow gully, an ancient
trail. In nature, context is everything. We scanned the land for the
easiest route, the most level, and then we looked for angles. Where
north-south paved roads ran, the Camino Real often bisected them today
at 45-degree angles. We spent a lot of time in the Jeep slowing down,
reversing, advancing, retracing our path. At one point, south of
Socorro, Jackson remarked that the oxen from trail-day caravans ate
beans off the mesquite tree, and the beans left behind in the cattle&rsquo;s
droppings eventually grew into trees, so there were areas where long,
straight rows of mesquite trees amid otherwise random vegetation were
obvious clues to the Camino Real.</p>
<p>Later we drove to San Pedro, a ghost town in New Mexico and once a stop
along the trail, where a field of long-abandoned adobe houses has slowly
dissolved during years of rain, sun, and neglect. One small ravine, once
surely an acequia, was now host to tangles of weeds, paddle cactus, and
thornbushes that crackled under my hiking boots. In the far distance
Jackson and I heard voices coming from several trailers, followed by two
distinctive pops of a shotgun. &ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better not linger,&rdquo; he said,
making his way slowly back toward the car. I was reluctant to leave.
There are places on the trail today still populated, some large, some
small, but none that I had seen like San Pedro, whose ravaged buildings
so powerfully suggested the sad place between existing and forgotten.</p>
<p>From New Mexico, Jackson and I made our way south toward Mexico, via the
infamous <i xml:lang="es">Jornada del Muerto</i>⁠—in English, the Journey of the Dead Man.
Christened after Oñate&rsquo;s day, it maintains the name still. A ninety-mile
swatch of desolation between Socorro and Las Cruces, this was one of
three long <i xml:lang="es">jornadas</i> through enormous chunks of desert. The flat, sandy
plain was punctuated by paddle cactus and what Jackson called, in
geographer&rsquo;s parlance, &ldquo;desert pavement&quot;⁠—rocks blown by the wind off
nearby mountains. Caravans often left after 4:00 p.m. and traveled
through the night to avoid the jornada&rsquo;s relentless sun. Water was a
constant worry, and travelers&rsquo; journals again and again described the
white bones of man and beast littering the landscape. Even I, a modern
traveler with all the conveniences, did not escape the jornada, when I
pulled out a blood-tipped mesquite thorn that had gone through the sole
of my shoe and lodged in my foot. Gregg&rsquo;s section of the Jornada del
Muerto told of the luck his party had had in not losing a single person
during the crossing. &ldquo;One thing appears very certain,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;that
this dangerous pass has cost the life of many travelers in days of
yore&hellip; we felt truly grateful that the arid Jornada had not been
productive of more serious consequences to our party.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In El Paso we met up with CARTA&rsquo;s president, George Torok, and Ben
Brown, an archeologist employed by Mexico&rsquo;s National Institute of
Anthropology and History (<i xml:lang="es">Instituto Nacionale de Antropologia e
Historia</i>), whose work has led him to study various areas around or on
the Camino Real. Brown and Torok showed us around several border areas
where the Spaniards took up residence after their expulsion in 1680
during the Pueblo revolt.</p>
<p>We drove first through pecan groves and cornfields, to Ciudad Juárez,
the Mexican urban extension of El Paso and, after the Pueblo revolt, the
northernmost boundary of the Spanish territory. Two Camino Real routes
led south from Juárez. One, through sand dunes, has horrific accounts of
carcasses in the sand like those in the jornada; the second was less
direct but easier. Next to Juárez&rsquo;s enormous cathedral in the central
square stands the original whitewashed mission church built in 1659 and
the oldest mission along the trail still functioning. In the square this
day, preachers shouted Protestant theology into crackling loudspeakers,
and pigeons commanded the immediate airspace. Just south of the mission
a three-story covered market sat where the central market had stood
during trail days, when it marked an important resupply spot famous for
El Paso&rsquo;s wines, brandy, and fruit. Then it was the only place between
the Mexican city of Chihuahua and Santa Fe, New Mexico, where lush green
vegetation flourished, a fact no longer true in modern-day Juárez, with
its increasingly short water supply. &ldquo;The Camino Real is really a
communication trail,&rdquo; Ben Brown told me. &ldquo;Its social impact was with
knowledge and items going north and south. It&rsquo;s not just a trail in the
physical sense; it&rsquo;s really a concept of communication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We drove through various settlements where the Spanish retreated after
the 1680 revolt. Ysleta del Sur, Senecú, San Elizario, San Lorenzo, and
Socorro del Sur all were small communities and are laid out today as
they were in trail days, with a mission-style church, a central square,
and a small but growing sense of their place in history. At these
settlements, Torok told me, the names had changed, the Camino Real path
had changed, the river had changed, and the people and the culture had
continually changed. The Rio Grande, which is the established border
between the United States and Mexico, constantly shifts its location.
The earth is not silent, not static, even if we wish our boundaries to
be so. The river is far south of where it was in Oñate&rsquo;s day and, as a
result, makes for a rather odd choice for an international boundary
line.</p>
<p>In a little town called Bracito, which was a resting stop along the
trail in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a small but
significant battle took place during the Mexican War of 1846⁠–⁠48, right
in front of today&rsquo;s Bracito School. Brown and Jackson stood at the mouth
of an acequia respectfully debating the trail&rsquo;s location (Brown:
underneath the acequia; Jackson: alongside it) and why the Americans who
were outnumbered three-to-one by the Mexicans won the battle in twenty
minutes (Brown: Mexicans were an ill-treated peasant army with low
morale; Jackson: Americans were Missouri volunteers well used to their
weaponry). As they talked, each with one leg resting atop the modern
concrete wall of the old acequia, the sun began to set, lighting up the
school. Lightning shot down from the clouds in the distance, and sheets
of rain rolled in. Whether the Camino Real ran below or adjacent to the
acequia, today a railroad track crosses where we all stood discussing
what happened here once, watching as the storm and nightfall came on.</p>
<p>In Mexico, Jackson and I were alone again, searching for the first of
many areas we hoped to find that had eluded modern-day explorers,
including Ojo de Lucero, a spring that nearly every journal mentioned
that had watered a rest stop from Oñate&rsquo;s day. In the Mexican state of
Chihuahua, Jackson scanned the placid golden landscape, and I felt the
Jeep slow. He pulled the car off the highway onto a two-track dust road
in the middle of the desert. I hadn&rsquo;t even seen the two-track, let alone
whatever infinitesimal clue between this swatch of desert and the last
had made him turn off for closer inspection. To Jackson, each new vista
of desert offered a slightly altered landscape, a tiny promise of
discovery. The Lucero spring would have once held enough water for a
thousand people or more to drink, wash, and cook from for a few days in
a trailside camp, but today it would be only an enormous indentation in
the earth. If we found Lucero, we would be among just a handful of
people in the world who knew where it was now, and who knew that it once
meant, for many thousands of people, survival.</p>
<p>Jackson drove a mile off the highway on the two-track until we reached a
private ranch in the midst of new construction. A man in a construction
hat walked briskly to our car and peered in suspiciously. Jackson waved
a greeting, rolling down his window. The man told us that what we wanted
was across the highway. &ldquo;<i xml:lang="es">No aqui</i>,&rdquo; he said several times in a voice
meant to warn us away from our folly. Jackson gunned the engine, backed
up, and retraced our route to the highway, at which point he grumbled,
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know what the hell we&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moments later he spotted a flash of aqua blue up ahead. &ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; he said
enigmatically. Jackson read the landscape as an artist reads a blank
canvas, wrought with possibility and inherently full of layers and
details that the rest of us nonartists could not imagine. The blue dot
became clearer as we drove, and I saw that it was an <i xml:lang="es">alberca</i>, a public
swimming pool. Jackson conversed with the alberca&rsquo;s maintenance man,
and he pointed in the direction we had come from. Afterward Jackson
turned to me rather as a superhero might to his faithful but somewhat
ineffectual sidekick and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the maps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Jeep parked askew amid mesquite trees and choya
cactus with pipe-cleaner arms, we stood at Ojo de Lucero. We&rsquo;d driven
along a two-track past scattered ranches, then turned into the desert
until the trees got too thick to drive, and then we walked, carrying
bundles of papers, maps, and Jackson&rsquo;s digital GPS. Several hundred
yards away was a tiny village, so Jackson knew there was a water source
from somewhere. We noted nearby power lines, which showed up on the topo
maps, and after a brief tromp through the desert, we stood at a shallow
dry indentation in the earth, a small pipe pumping water through the
desert.</p>
<p>The finding, though, was remarkably anticlimactic. Jackson marked the
spot in his GPS device, then grinned for a moment until his mind jumped
to what we had yet to find. In the world of Hal Jackson, if something
hadn&rsquo;t been found in four hundred-or-so years, it wasn&rsquo;t so much a matter of its
concealment as that no one had ever really bothered to look. Lucero was
an auspicious sign of things to come.</p>
<p>We drove on through the Mexican desert. At Carrizal we stopped at what
had once been a presidio. The walls had dwindled to a rectangular speed
bump in the earth. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, Spaniards bribed Apaches with food to ward off thievery in
what was likely the first real attempt at social welfare. Later, in
1916, Americans⁠—mostly Buffalo Soldiers⁠—lost a small battle to
Mexicans here. In the distance, dust devils flitted across faraway
plains. <i>You could watch your dog run away for days in land like this</i>, I
told Jackson, a phrase often said of the Midwest, where I happened to
live. Jackson laughed, then, grew thoughtful. Every place you ever go
will be compared with where you came from: the weather, the
architecture, the context. &ldquo;You never escape your own landscape,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like gum on your shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later we searched for another <i xml:lang="es">ojo</i>: Caliente. Like Lucero, it was
mentioned in every journal; unlike Lucero, Jackson didn&rsquo;t know of many
people who had ever managed to locate it. Using topo maps, we pulled off
the highway onto a two-track and searched through the flat-planed dust
for a road shown on the map. We drove up, looked, reversed, drove back
up, looked again, and reversed, over and over. Between the irrigated
alfalfa fields, the russet land managed only an occasional barrel
cactus. Suddenly, a migrant worker appeared at the window of our Jeep.
After the man gave us directions, Jackson and I easily spotted the tiny
road that had eluded us. We lifted a metal-wire gate off its wooden
hinge and drove in till we had to hoof it through the mesquite. Two
things appeared in front of us: an enormous ocher-and-bronze-colored
church⁠—too new to be Caliente⁠—and a lone brown cow.</p>
<p>We split up and searched through the trees, more animals appearing as we
wandered: horses, cows, quail, a blackeared jackrabbit. Suddenly, in the
distance, I heard Jackson hollering. He was buried deep in the trees, so
I followed his voice and saw first the old church. It was just as
Gregg&rsquo;s journal and so many others had said: graveyard next to the
church, <i xml:lang="es">padre</i>&rsquo;s home opposite. If this was really Ojo de Caliente, we
could expect an enormous ojo and the Camino Real trail leading
smack-dab into the church.</p>
<p>I found Jackson standing in the middle of the hole. It was dried up now,
probably forty-by-twenty feet, but huge trees around its circumference
suggested that water abounded deep down. Jackson was downright giddy.
Around the ojo and church were mounds that had once been adobe houses.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probable that no modern explorer has ever been here,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And certainly no settlement for ninety or so years.&rdquo; He jog-walked from end
to end in the ojo, measured the whole thing, and took a GPS position.
Lizards darted across the ground. We felt as if we had been granted the
memory of every traveler who ever walked that land. We ran atop and
through the ojo, took pictures in the padre&rsquo;s quarters, padded over
the mounds where houses once stood. Then we wandered around to the back
of the church, and there it was, clear as day: a single straight brown
swale surrounded on both sides by overgrown mesquite trees. The Camino Real,
with all but street signs pointing it out. Our elation was so great
we simply stared, overwhelmed, silenced.</p>
<p>We found other things: the route of the trail in a charming, colorful
village called Valle de Allende, where the air was cool, the trees were
voluminous, and the town smelled of wet earth and roasted chilies. Oñate
and his minions had crossed a stream there. We drove on past rolling
green hills, out of the desert and into a land of eucalyptus and pine,
to a town called Villa Hidalgo today and Cerro Gordo back in the trail
days. We found the makings of an old presidio wall possibly from those
trail days.</p>
<p>On a side road made of what appeared to be a scattering of stones
embedded at random in the dirt, Jackson peered so close for so long that
a pattern emerged. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;a straight line of rocks. You
see that? That&rsquo;s not accidental.&rdquo; He got so excited he had to take a
breath. &ldquo;That was put there by someone. <em>On purpose</em>.&rdquo; A moment later an
old Indian couple walked out of a nearby doorway and greeted us. Jackson
pointed to the rocks. <i xml:lang="es">&ldquo;Camino Real, aqui?&rdquo; </i> he asked. The woman
shrugged and invited us into her home, where her husband, in peasant hat
and beat-up jeans, confirmed that indeed his home was on the trail. The
rocks, he told us, were the old method of paving. We sat then and talked
with them about what we were doing: a fusion of generations, cultures,
and languages, exploring a history of generations, cultures, and
languages.</p>
<p>That night a band of musicians walked through the streets of Zacatecas,
Mexico, where Oñate&rsquo;s family was once famous for its silver mines. There
are still Oñates there today, and the pink-stoned buildings of Zacatecas
are still surrounded by mines whose silver is coveted the world over.
Tomorrow we would head to Oñate&rsquo;s birthplace, Pánuco, and search for the
spot where everything started, but tonight we would celebrate. As the
band marched, people in the streets followed until the crowd was more
than a block long. Car horns wailed as the entourage passed. Jackson and
I were swept up with the throng, hurrying along the cobblestones behind
the band. On the sidewalks, people danced, and the band stopped and
played for several couples. A Mexican man in a white shirt pulled me by
the hand and swung me around to the music. I laughed, and Jackson
snapped a picture, and then the skies opened, and raindrops the size of
pebbles crashed over our heads and all around us. But the band played
on, and I kept dancing.</p>
