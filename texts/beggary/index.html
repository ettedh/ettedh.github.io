<p>McHoehandle and I stood at the
sloppy counter at Louie&rsquo;s, just making
things worse by drinking a Stein of
what Louie puts out under the label, and libel,
of beer. A few months ago, a report went the
rounds that beer was going to follow Middle
West Utilities&rsquo; lead and go down to fifteen cents.
It never did. McHoehandle can afford twenty-five-cent
beer. I cannot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said McHoehandle, wiping
the collar of foam from his lips with the back
of his hand, &ldquo;I am getting tired of this
depression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo; I asked.
McHoehandle works for a university and
hasn&rsquo;t had his salary cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depresses me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to
think about people who haven&rsquo;t enough to eat.
I have too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How often do you think about people who
haven&rsquo;t enough to eat?&rdquo; I asked him.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think about them very often, at
first. I am very lightly endowed with human
pity, and as long as they didn&rsquo;t stand in front
of me and starve I didn&rsquo;t think about them.
But now they&rsquo;re everywhere. They&rsquo;re on the
boulevards and in the parks. They&rsquo;re on
shady streets in nice neighborhoods and around
the corner from expensive restaurants. You
can tell they&rsquo;re starving by looking at them.
Their nerve is gone⁠—they don&rsquo;t even beg.
You see a thousand every day. I tell you, it
gives a man a turn. Let&rsquo;s have another beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t drown the world&rsquo;s sorrows in
Louie&rsquo;s galvanized beer. I doubt that anything
exhilarates when you get into McHoehandle&rsquo;s
mood. I&rsquo;ve been in it for months. But I&rsquo;ve
been afraid to open my trap. It&rsquo;s like the
plague that knocked Europe into a cocked hat
about five hundred years ago. The best people
sat around in their ruby-studded castles drinking
out of gold goblets and keeping the shades
pulled down so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to see what
was going on beyond the moat. If you try to
tell people what you&rsquo;ve seen on West Madison
Street or under Wacker drive, they tell you to
stow it⁠—aren&rsquo;t they feeling terrible enough
without having to think about that? Sure they
are; so you stow it.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose talking
about it, especially in this maudlin fashion,
does any good. But nothing else seems to do
any better. The people who still have a little
money left have dumped millions into the
relief chests. I suppose there has been a little
graft, and a little waste⁠—but not much. There
are too many honest people keeping an eye on
each other for anyone to make a man-sized
haul. Where has it all gone?⁠—and it has all
gone. Into thin soup and thin stew, into
more thin soup and more thin stew, into the
bellies of the starving. When it&rsquo;s all gone,
they&rsquo;re still starving, every last one of them.
And when you think of that, you say to yourself,
&ldquo;What in the devil is going to happen?&rdquo;
But you don&rsquo;t know the answer to that, so
you cut short your ponderations with, &ldquo;good
God&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s terrible,&rdquo; and go on about your
business, if you have any.</p>
<p>At least that was the way I faced the
problem until about a year ago, when I was
put back into circulation by one of the great,
teetering corporations of this city. I had my
choice of begging or writing. Begging, I knew,
had always been the more profitable enterprise,
in flush times anyway. But it meant a
great deal of footwork and no less of hat-tipping,
neither of which has ever been my
special forte. So I decided in favor of a life,
while it lasted, of letters.</p>
<p>The position of such a person in the economic
maelstrom is in many ways enviable. He
does not have a steady income, which is decidedly
disadvantageous, from the spiritual
standpoint at least; and there is, or was, until
recently, a certain embarrassment connected
with the inability to provide a business address.
On the credit side of being unemployed, however,
there are plenty of items. It is, first, a
sobering state for a young man who had always
assumed, with all young men, that the world
was his oyster. Moreover, happy is he bound
to be who escapes the exasperating fate of the
wage-slave, even if he escapes, perforce, by the
back door. And finally, and most importantly,
to the man who has lost his job there is thrown
back the curtain on golden vistas of perspective:
he is able to appreciate the terrors as well
as the discomforts of destitution, and to feel
them, if only vicariously.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is no small solace to a
man of my kidney to be able to chuck the
frigid no of refusal for &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, partner,
but I&rsquo;m out of work myself.&rdquo; The distaste for
encountering beggars and having to refuse
them has always been acute in me. I have
tried various methods, such as ignoring them
or crossing to the other side of the street, but
no such device has ever given complete satisfaction.
Several times a day, and the several
grew by bounds as conditions went from worse
to worse, I found myself face-to-face with the
sad spectacle of a man whose eyes glittered
with hunger and whose lips implored a nickel.
The plain, peace-loving citizen who does not
enjoy abusing these wraiths with the
why-don&rsquo;t-you-go-to-the-proper-place type of sermon has no alternative: he has to say no.
And saying no twenty times a day not only
tries a man&rsquo;s patience but tends, after a while,
to take the sun out of the sky. The clinging, if
erroneous, suspicion that each &ldquo;No&rdquo; deprives
a life, however unworthy, of its last mote of
hope does not add to the cheer of the evening
meal.</p>
<p>This stony manner, so indigenous to success
in finance, is particularly hard, it seems
to me, for the green and tractable young man
to assume. And I, although I am aging fast,
am a green and tractable young man. I would
be of no use behind a wicket, but I have an
extremely nifty light gray suit, which a man
in Selma, Alabama, sold me three years ago by
telling me that I looked like a million dollars
in it. The lining looks like the flag Napoleon
took at Austerlitz, and the edges of the sleeves
and collar are somewhat rubbed down, but I
will say that when I wear it, even now, I look
like a millionaire. That this was no idle conceit,
I realized by checking the number of times
I was approached for small coins when I wore
the million dollar garment against the number
of times I was approached when wearing my
less-imposing Richman Bros.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> creation of blue
serge. The count was so distressing that I
have, actually, abandoned the millionaire model
altogether.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are hoboes, of
course, in this hobo capital of the world, and
begging is a career with them, as gunning is
with the Capones and banking with the Morgans.
You couldn&rsquo;t get them to do anything
else. About half a million of the professionally
tattered blow in and out of the city every
year, with stopover privileges. Fifty thousand,
I suppose, comprise the home guard, sauntering
amiably up and down West Madison, North
Clark, and South State streets, sojourning more
or less regularly in the county brig, and earning
their cigarette money by repeating at local
elections. Like the German Army in 1915,
every time one of them falls, another fills his
place. In the old days, it was a fair gamble that
every bum who asked for a bit of change was
simply pursuing his chosen vocation, and it did
not take the measure of a man to spurn him.</p>
<p>Today, we know that half the feet that
shuffle wretchedly along the streets once wore
shiny new shoes, at least on Sundays, or reposed
under mahogany desks, or even on them.</p>
<p>They stand in the doorways and watch for a
kind face⁠—each snarl of refusal brings them a
little nearer the nadir of their self-respect.
They were not born to the purple of beggary.
They wear glasses, so many of them, and it is
an obvious truism that few denizens of the
blind baggage ever have their eyes examined,
the better to read Spinoza or Hegel. They
straighten their spotted ties. They wash their
shirts and handkerchiefs in the lake each morning.
They wipe their wayworn shoes with
newspapers, and they brush their dirty clothes
with their dirty hands. They try to stop a
prospective philanthropist without being seen
by the passing crowds, and they do not look
up, ever.</p>
<p>These men are no bums. Half the day, they
are trying to get work, knowing they can&rsquo;t, and
half the day, they are trying to get money,
somehow, to keep them⁠—and too often wives
and children⁠—alive. It is pretty sad. Who
wants to hear their story, who, hurrying by,
has the time or the patience? So it&rsquo;s just, in a
shameful voice, &ldquo;Can you help me out, mister?&rdquo;
and a worrying world doesn&rsquo;t differentiate,
and the shame in the voice is unheard.</p>
<p>Young men, old women⁠—young men and
old women never begged in this country before.
A man goes down Van Buren Street, thirty-five
perhaps, with a woman carrying a baby⁠—
&ldquo;Can you help me out, mister?&rdquo; An old man
with a roll of newspapers under his arm stands
in front of a cafeteria on Wabash Avenue
looking in the window, hard; the manager
comes to the door and the old man moves on,
stumbling. A boy of twenty-five, his cheap
blue suit clean and frayed, falls down on Fifty-Fifth
Street and doesn&rsquo;t move; they lift him up;
he isn&rsquo;t drunk; he has no voice and his lips
say &ldquo;Food;&rdquo; he is carried to a restaurant; he
drinks a bowl of soup in one gulp, and falls
asleep.</p>
<hr>
<p>I sit at home at my
typewriter; the back doorbell rings all day.
Kids eight and ten have cookies. A fat, rheumatic
old man has home-made horse-radish. A
thin woman in black, thirty or thirty-five, has
macaroons. All ages⁠—both sexes⁠—have
baskets of sundries. A man plays the violin,
very, very badly, in the street. A middle-aged
man, with glasses and a white shirt, can repair
anything. A little fellow with no chin and
red eyes says, &ldquo;Can you help me out, mister,
or are you out of work yourself?&rdquo; A man of
fifty, with a horizontal forehead, looks like a
killer, asks for a few pennies to help him buy
a drink. I live on the third floor. I quit answering
the bell⁠—it doesn&rsquo;t do any good.</p>
<p>Who tries to differentiate? Who wants to
hear a life story these days? Always there is
the profound suspicion that they are charlatans,
all of them, all professionals. Another
year of this and the suspicion will be gone.</p>
<p>Begging was once a good racket, like banking.
There was money to be made. They arrested
a man in 1929 in front of the First
National Bank when they discovered that he
lifted himself up on his crutches at the end of
the day and swung around the corner where a
Cadillac was waiting. He had $40,000 in the
bank. If you were deformed, and still not
horrible, and you had a good &ldquo;spot&rdquo; and took
care of the copper on the beat, you made good
money. If you were deformed and horrible,
you could move through the streets and old
ladies in lace collars would give you a quarter
and keep their heads averted. There is still
some of that, and who differentiates? The old
fellow who played his blind violin at the corner
of Michigan and Harrison for fifteen or
twenty years died a few months ago and the
thirty cents in his cup was all he had.</p>
<hr>
<p>They tell me there are
1,558,843 &ldquo;gainful workers&rdquo; in Chicago, a
conservative 750,000 of whom are out of gainful
work. At least 130,000 families are subsisting
entirely on charity. The third winter
is coming up. Private and public
strongboxes are almost hollow. Relatives and
friends are on their uppers, after two years
of doubled burden and quartered income.
Some of the half million will die this winter⁠—
some died last winter and the winter before.
The soup lines and the relief stations will be
crowded with deserving and undeserving, and
there is no one to differentiate. I suppose it
would take a lot of money to differentiate, for
to differentiate means to investigate. The givers
of funds would set up a holler, I don&rsquo;t
doubt, if half their money was used in the administration
of the other half. They want to
feed people, any people. That is laudable in
itself. Giving, this winter, will not be easy for
many, and many will have to give. But I think
it would be intelligent if as much as half of
what money there is, is spent in feeding the
people who deserve to be kept alive. I suspect
that, generally, three-fourths of the money
feeds men whose one contribution to civilization,
if they are given a chance, is liable to be
the reproduction of their kind.</p>
<p>The communists, or perhaps I should say
Communists, are getting along very poorly.
Communism, like all great institutions, requires
a certain amount of cash on hand, and the
exchequer of District 8 is moaning low. Together
with this, the Cause has been met so
coldly by the <i xml:lang="fr">nouveau pauvre</i> that plans for
the Big Push, purportedly from Moscow, have
been indefinitely postponed.</p>
<p>Observation on a modest scale has convinced
me that there will be no revolution, even if
Hoover is reelected.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Riots there will be, riots
like last winter&rsquo;s: weak, sporadic, unorganized.
This thing has struck so suddenly⁠—three years
is an instant in social cataclysms⁠—that its victims
are too punch-drunk, too staggered, to
fight. It will take a hundred years more of
this. It will take a peasantry, and we haven&rsquo;t
had a peasantry for the last sixty-five years.
As for the beggars, the vocation boys, they do
not make good revolutionists⁠—Communism
promises work for all, and that is no attraction.</p>
<p>There is, it is true, a lighter side, much
lighter, to the whole business. Among the &ldquo;upper
middle classes,&rdquo; among those who are reasonably
certain that they will have enough to
eat, and enough to drink, come what may, or
come what may not, it is a very graceful matter
to be out of work. It is, I find, actually
becoming fashionable. You can readily imagine
what socially desirable people were turned
loose by the collapse of the better banks and
business houses and by reductions in the staffs
of newspapers, universities, hospitals, libraries
and executive departments of major industries.</p>
<p>The members of this new leisure class rather
enjoyed weekending all week, golfing, getting
out in the country, lolling around the art museums
or the clubs or the zoo. As their ranks
increased, they adopted a definite attitude of
smug content. They belonged. People who
went downtown every day were vulgar. A
man with a job was a menace to organized
society. It will be too bad if things pick up,
because this admirable new social structure
will, I am afraid, have to be abandoned. If
things go on as they are, however, it will only
be a question of how much longer the decent,
law-abiding citizens of this community are
going to tolerate the employed.</p>
