			<p>This text is a chapter from the book <i>Blazing Alaska&rsquo;s Trails</i>, a collection of undated essays by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hulse_Brooks">Alfred Hulse Brooks</a> about life in early Alaska. The text here is from a scan I made from the 1972 edition, which I have marked up and edited for the web. As Brooks died in 1924, the text should be in the public domain. (Note: as of October 4, all the text is here. I need to come back and add the pictures at prime locations.)</p>
<h1 id="early-alaska-transportation">Early Alaska Transportation</h1>
<p>The period of evolution from man-carried burdens to
railroad transport, from raft and dugout to steamboat,
is coextensive with the advance of man from savagery to
civilization, a period to be measured by many thousands of
years. In Alaska, however, the most primitive modes of
transport are often found side by side with the most highly
developed: the prospector leaving a railroad coach and
shouldering his heavy pack becomes a beast of burden, as
was the man of the stone age; the tourist may photograph
from comfortable steamers the little bark canoe of the
Yukon native; a modern ocean steamer anchored at Nome
will be visited by the primitive skin boats of the Eskimo.</p>
<p>Less than two decades ago, no Alaskan valleys had echoed
in the whistle of the locomotive, and a score of its navigable
rivers had never felt the rhythmic chug of the
steamer. Now<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> there are over seven hundred miles of railroad in the
Territory, and some form of steamboat service is found
on nearly all Alaskan rivers. Of the tens of thousands
who essayed the heart-breaking task of dragging and carrying
their supplies through the passages in the mountainous
coastal barrier, there were probably few who could realize
that within a few years it would be possible to reach the
Yukon by rail in not-as-many days as they took months
for the journey.</p>
<p>Transport is the very essence of frontier life. Progress
of industry and settlement are absolutely controlled by the
means of transport. The pioneer whose mission is to obtain
or to harvest rich deposits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placer_mining">placer gold</a> can, by hard
labor, carry out his projects through means of transport
of his own development. If, however, other resources are
to be utilized, such as the fertility of the soil, beds of coal,
deposits of copper and gold veins, and if permanent settlements
are to be made and homes to be built, steamboats,
railroads, and wagon roads must be provided.</p>
<p>While much the larger part of Alaska is still almost as
inaccessible as it was in its earliest history, yet the railroads,
the automobile roads already built, and the well-established
steamer service have revolutionized the transport
system. This fact, and this alone, has made possible
the beginnings of a systematic industrial development of
the Northland. The relative efficiency and approximate
cost of the most important means of transport in Alaska
are shown in the following table:</p>

<p>Though the cost figures given in this table are only an
approximation, yet they give a measure of the difficulties
with which the pioneer who provides his own transport
has to contend and show why large industrial advancement
is only possible when modern means of transport are available.
Historical evidence of this truth is also found in the
evolution of Alaskan settlement and industry. Until the
Klondike gold was discovered in the 1890s, the only settlements
in Alaska of any importance were at tidewater.
The great interior contained only a few roving prospectors,
and a dozen trading posts on the Yukon and Kuskokwim
rivers were the only permanent settlements. The extraordinarily
rich gold deposits of the Klondike and later those
of Fairbanks, Nome, and other camps, made possible certain
industrial advancements, but these constituted no permanent
prosperity. It is only the construction of railroads
and wagon roads which has led to the development of the
resources of inland regions other than the rich placers.</p>
<h2 id="commercial-shipping">Commercial shipping</h2>
<p>When we took over Alaska from Russia, commerce, as
has been previously pointed out, was confined to that of
the fur trader along the coast and the lower courses of
the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers. The coastal settlements
were served by a few smaller steamers, and extraneous
commerce was by sailing vessels chiefly operating between
Sitka and Petropavlovsk on the east shore of Kamchatka.
Once a year, a ship arrived direct from Kronstadt on the
Baltic. The few overland journeys of the Russians were
by dog teams, and traffic on the rivers was by skin boats
or scows.</p>
<p>The steamers carrying the Commission and the troops
to Alaska in 1867 were among the first ocean steamers to
be seen in these waters.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> At this time, the steamer <i>John L.
Stephens</i> also made her first voyage from San Francisco
to Sitka. This inaugurated a monthly service which was
the only communication with Alaska for twenty years, when a
semi-monthly service was begun.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> These vessels ran from
San Francisco to Sitka and Wrangell, with occasional stops
at other settlements in Southeastern Alaska. After 1871,
when the Cassiar gold discovery of British Columbia was
made, a field which was reached by the Stikine River route,
the Wrangell call be came the most important, for this
city was then the industrial center of Alaska. It could
also be reached by a small vessel operated by the Hudson
Bay Company which gave an intermittent service between
Victoria and Wrangell.</p>
<p>For over twenty years, the traveler who wished to go beyond
Sitka had to rely on the occasional vessels of the Revenue
Cutter Service or the fur companies, or on the small craft
of the fisherman and the small trader, for there was no
regular communication with other Alaskan ports. There
was no mail service outside of Southeastern Alaska until
1891, when a contract was made to carry mail to Unalaska
during the summer months.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> It fell to Alaska Commercial
Company, which took over the fur trade of the
Russian American Company and obtained the first lease on
the Seal Islands, to establish communication with Alaskan
ports other than those of Southeastern Alaska. The company
posts on Cook Inlet, Kodiak, Unalaska, and Saint Michael
were reached by vessels running to San Francisco. At
first, small steam schooners were used, later vessels of
a thousand tons or more, Early in the ’70s, a more or less regular
communication was established with the principal ports,
later developing into a regular carrier servidce. By 1879,
the steamer <i>St. Paul</i> was making a seasonal call at Saint
Michael, ant the famous little steamer <i>Dora</i> was supplying
the ports on the Aleutian and Pribilof islands. Later,
the steamers running to Kodiak and Saint Michael became
public carriers, and the same was true of the river steamers
on the Yukon.</p>

</figure>
<p>The <i>Dora</i> is perhaps the most famous of Alaska’s vessels,
and has a record of 40 years of service. At different times
she has served as a poacher of seal on the high seas, as a
transport for furs and supplies, as a passenger boat, and
finally as a fish boat. Originally built as a brig, she was
later given steam power and for years plowed the dangerous
waters of Bering Sea. From 1891 to 1900, the <i>Dora</i>
plied between Sitka and the ports to the westward as far
as Unalaska. In 1900, she carried the local traffic from
Saint Michael to Nome and other settlements along the southern
coast of Bering Sea. Later, for many years, she was
the mail boat between Seward and Alaska Peninsula ports.
The <i>Dora</i>, in spite of her great age, was always a staunch
sea craft and weathered many a fierce gale that carried her
hither and yon, for she had little steam power. She has
perhaps the record for carrying more passengers with more
discomfort than any vessel which ever reached Alaskan
waters.</p>
<p>Though the reaching of Alaskan ports in the early history
of the Territory presented many vexations, delays,
and difficulties, these were the least of the transportation
obstacles met with by the pioneer. Once landed with his
outfit, he had to make further progress entirely on his own
efforts. It was then a question of packing his supplies
on his back, building his own boat, <em>or</em>, where conditions
favored, making use of dog teams.</p>
<h2 id="sleds">Sleds</h2>
<p>Countless generations of Alaskan natives have used the
dog for transport, and he is to Alaska what the yak is to
India, or the llama to Peru. The climatic and topographic
features of the Pacific seaboard are not favorable to sledding:
the winter snows do not last long enough; and the
heavy timbers and steep slopes also make the use of dog
teams impractical. But the gently rolling upland region
of the interior with its broad flat valleys and lack of thick
timber furnished admirable sleigh routes, especially over
the smooth surfaces of the many watercourses. The long
cold winters also favored sled transportation, the season
extending from November to May. The snowfall seldom
exceeds three feet, but it remains continuous all winter,
a fact which also favored the use of sleds.</p>
<p>Hand sleds have been used as well as dog sleds, and many
a gold seeker dragged his heavy sled for hundreds of miles.
From 150 to 200 pounds is all a man can pull over an
average trail. But in sledding over river or lake ice, he
can take advantage of fair winds by employing improvised
sails of the type used on the upper Yukon during the
Klondike rush. The dog sled is, however, the typical
mode of transport in inland Alaska as well as for the tundra
region of the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean. Originally
there were two rather sharply differentiated types of sled
dogs in Alaska: the malamute or <i>Eskimo dog</i>, and the
“husky” or dog introduced from the Mackenzie valley,
probably by the Hudson Bay traders.</p>
<h3 id="dogs">Dogs</h3>
<p>The malamute, originally the sled dog of the Bering Sea
and Arctic coastal region, is now widely distributed in
the Interior. The same family of dogs is found along the
entire Arctic coast of Canada and in Greenland, and has
provided the power for most of the sleds of the Arctic
explorers. Their short, stocky build, their strong shoulders,
their pointed ears and noses, and their gracefully arched
tails are familiar to all through the illustrations in narratives
of polar adventure. A good-sized malamute will weigh
75 or 80 pounds. The malamute varies in color from almost
snow white to black, gray, and mottled.</p>
<p>The husky has longer legs and body than the malamute,
is loosely built, and has a dense though shorter coat of
fur. His resemblance to a timber wolf is very strong, and
he appears to be a much more powerful animal than the
malamute. He is more vicious too, but he is nevertheless
perhaps the favorite sled dog, especially in the heavy
freighting of the interior.</p>
<p>The Yukon Indians also had a dog on the first coming of
the white man. It resembled the malamute but was smaller
and not so powerful. These dogs, generally called <i xml:lang="chn">siwash</i>,
are probably the degenerate offspring of the coastal malamute;
and generations of underfeeding and abuse have
produced an inferior breed. It is probable that the Athabaskans,
the true Indians of the interior, got their first
knowledge of sled dogs from the Eskimo.</p>
<p>The pure breeds of both malamute and husky are rapidly
disappearing along the well-traveled routes by the inbreeding
of native with imported stock. Many drivers
prefer these cross-breed dogs, the offspring of native dogs
and collies, setters, pointers, spaniels, Newfoundlands, and
Saint Bernards. The pure-bred imported dogs, while more
intelligent and tractable than the native animals, have not
their endurance and resistance. One of the great faults
is the tenderness of their feet on a rough trail. Some of
the half-breeds, however, combine the endurance of their
native blood with the intelligence and gentleness of their
imported ancestors, and these make the most valuable
draft animals. A common practice is to use an outside
dog as the intelligent leader of a team of more hardy
native dogs. The leader controlled by the commands of
the driver, guides the dogs that follow.</p>
<p>Dried salmon is the standard dog food throughout Alaska.
It is surprising how much work a dog can perform on a
pound and a half of salmon a day. Large dogs engaged in
continuous travel should, however, receive from two and
a half to three pounds of food a day. They show the greatest
endurance when fed a diet of fish and a cereal, such as
rice or oatmeal, and bacon or lard at a ratio of 1:1½;
and the best practice is to cook all the food,
which, of course, is necessary for the cereal. Dogs are
fed only at night, no morning or noon meal being provided.
Most of the Indian dogs, and indeed many of those owned
by whites, in summer are much undernourished. This
makes them most arrant thieves, and every cache of provisions
must by carefully barricaded against dogs. Even
well-fed sled dogs are not to be trusted and will devour
or destroy footwear and even their own harness. The native
dogs require no housing in the coldest winter weather and,
after being fed, will curl up and sleep in the snow, even
though a blizzard be howling. Their shaggy skins are
proof against the mosquito, ever present in the summer, but
these insects sometimes torture them by stings about the
eyes and nose.</p>

<p>There is no standard size for an Alaskan dog team. A
prospector may drag a sled loaded with his 200 or 300
pounds of supplies with the aid of a single dog, or a driver
may have a team of nine dogs or more. A driving team,
however, usually includes not less than five or not more
than nine dogs. Much larger teams are sometimes used
for heavy freight. There is a known instnace of dogs being
used for hauling the heavy steel shaft of a gold dredge
from Knik, at the head of Cook Inlet, to the Idiatarod
district, a distance of nearly five hundred miles; the route led over
a mountain pass in the heart of the Alaska Range and,
though the journey was performed under great difficulties,
the trip was completed successfully.</p>
<p>[picture 1-2]
<strong>The Alaskan dog team</strong>
Dogs are widely used for hauling sleds over the snow on cross country trips (left),
but they are sometimes also used in a less orthodox fashion such as (right), pulling a
wheeled vehicle over the railroads tracks on the Seward Penisula. Photos by
J. B. Mertie.</p>
<p>Sled dogs are hitched both tandem and in pairs, with
an extra leader. For tandem driving, traces are used, and
the rig is not unlike that for horses. In pair driving, the
traces of each dog are merely hitched to a single tow line.
If the dogs are staggered along the tow line, the team
can adjust itself to any width of trail. The fan-shaped rig
of Greenland, by which each dog is attached to the sled
by a separate tow line and the team spreads out radially,
is not adapted to narrow trails and is unknown in Alaska.
Each dog is fitted with a padded leather collar from which
his traces reach back and are attached to the tow line.</p>
<p>Distance of a day’s trail for a dog team and weight pulled
vary so much, depending on condition of trail, on graident
of course, and on weight and endurance of dogs, that it is
dififcult to generalize. Where a new trail is being broken
and where there are steep gradients, 50 pounds to the dog
is an ample load. Indeed, in some cross-country journeys,
this load may have to be reduced to 30 or 40 pounds. On
the other hand, over a smooth, hard, level trail, strong
dogs have been known to drag as much as 300 pounds. It
is probably safe to say that a good dog on hard, level trails
should haul 100 pounds—that is, about 25 percent more
than his own weight. this load he will not take over 15
or 20 miles a day. Reduce this weight to 50 pounds, and
the dog should make 25 miles a day. The famous dog races
at Nome have shown that a dog team hauling only the
empty sled can average nearly 90 miles a day for five
days.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> The winter mail contracts call, on the average, for
a speed of 22 miles a day; but the carriers frequently
exceed this, runs of over 40 miles a day having been recorded.
The mail carriers haul from 50 to 75 pounds of
weight per dog.</p>
<p>Many long journeys have been made over well-beaten
trails by good “dog mushers” where a day’s average travel
was 25 miles. This, however, is hard work for the driver
as well as the dogs. The driver seldom rides on the sled,
except on down grades, but runs behind, guiding and
steadying it by the handle bars. Where a new trail has
to be broken through new snow, a man on snowshoes goes
in advance of the team.</p>
<p>The dog sleds are 8–12 feet long and about 20–24
inches wide. They are strong, built of hickory or oak,
and made not too rigid. A certain looseness and pliability
allow the runners to follow the tracks. Small sleds weigh
about 75 pounds, large ones nearly 200. For freighting,
flat sleds are used, sometimes with a “gee pole” for guiding
at the front where the driver helps haul the load, sometimes
with the gee pole at the rear. Travel sleds are made
with a basked superstructure and two handles at the rear.
These are used by the driver to guide the sled, and when
opportunity offers he steps on the rear of the sled for
short rides.</p>
<p>Dogs are also used in summer to a limited extent as
pack animals by both Eskimo and Indian, and occasionally
a lone prospector will be found to make a similar use of
them. A dog will pack 20 or 30, even 40, pounds. Unless
thoroughly broken, these dogs are difficult to control, and
one of their favorite tricks is to lie down in water, pack
and all.</p>
<p><img src="pics/alaska/portage.webp" alt="Men on portage from one stream to another"></p>
<p>Backpacking is the most primitive and laborious mode
of transport and is resorted to only when all other means
fail. As an actual means of forwarding supplies, it is
used only between navigable waters, namely on portages.
A portage is chosen, so far as circumstances permit, so
as to afford firm footing and easy grades. The Chilkoot
Pass is the most famous portage in the world, for thousands
of tons of supplies have been carried across it. It lies
some twenty miles from and 3,100 feet above tidewater; and,
as has been indicated earlier, the appriach to it, though
easy enough at first, beocmes steep and difficult. To the
place called the “<a href="https://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/historyculture/the-scales-history.htm">Scales</a>,” sledding was feasible; but from
here on, a steep climb to the summit has to be made, and
transport was on the backs of men. This portage provided
the test that winnowed out the strong from the weak, the
stout-hearted from the failures. The average man found,
at least at the start, that 50 pounds was a heavy load up
the steep ascent; many learned later to carry 100 pounds,
though such a burden was a serious strain on the heart, and
some whose determination was greater than their strength
succumbed under it. Over an ordinary portage with hard
trail and no grade, most physically strong men will carry
100 pounds; and experienced packers will take 150 or even
200 pounds on a cross-country trip, through the hills and
mountains. But relatively few will carry more than 50
pounds, and that amount not over fifteen miles a day.</p>
<h3 id="horses">Horses</h3>
<p>In the Pacific seaboard region of Alaska, the best grasslands
are along the shores of Cook Inlet, on the Alaska
Peninsula, and on Kodiak Island. But these areas are by
no means all the grazing lands, and grass is sufficiently
abundant elsewhere to make the use of horses feasible
for summer journeys. There is much good pasturage in
the Susitna valley, especially on its western margin in the
Yentna River basin. The Copper River has less grazing
land in its basin, but it suffices for the traveler. Summer
pastures sufficient for pack train are widely distributed
in the great inland region beyond the Pacific ranges and
northward as far as the Arctic Mountains which divide
the Yukon waters from those flowing northward into the
Arctic Ocean. Some splendid grasslands are found in this
region, for example along the Tanana and its tributaries.
In other places again, such as north of the Yukon, the
grass is scant, but patches sufficient for a pack train can
usually be found at distances not exceeding a day’s march.
Horses have been used by the Geological Survey as far
north as the Arctic divide, and the International Boundary
Commission took a pack train all the way to the Arctic
Ocean along the 141st meridian, north of the Porcupine
River. As the Bering Sea is approached, nutritious grass becomes
scanter and is confined chiefly to the highlands, the
extensive lowlands being chiefly covered with moss and
marsh grass. In this region, only careful planning and
search for pasture will permit the use of pack horses.
Much the same is true of Seward Peninsula, though the
Geological Survey expeditions have traversed its entire
area with pack trains. There is some grassland even in
the Arctic Slope region of Alaska, but not in sufficient
abundance to make long pack train trips feasible. It is
probably safe to estimate that there are in Alaska some
300,000 square miles in which the grass is sufficiently abundant to permit the use of a pack train.</p>
<p>Horses were brought to the Yukon as early as 1885, but
they were relatively little used until the Klondike rush.
The first long pack train trip in Alaska was that made in
1891 by E. J. Glave and Jack Dalton when they went from
the coast into the Lake Kluane region, previously discussed
in Chapter 16.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> The Army exploration of 1898
were made in part with pack horses, and in 1899 the
Geological Survey first used horses. That summer, W. J.
Peters and I made the journey from Haines in Southeastern
Alaska to Eagle on the Yukon, a distance of nearly six hundred
miles, that has already been referred to in Chapter 16.
In 1902, I made what is perhaps the longest pack horse
journey ever accomplished in Alaska, from Cook Inlet, round the base of Mount McKinley, and on to the Yukon at
Rampart. In 105 days, the pack train traveled some 800
miles with the personnel going entirely on foot. At the
start, the horses were each loaded with 250 pound sacks;
but, as provisions were consumed at the rate of about 21
pounds a day, the packs gradually became lighter. On the
other hand, some of the least strong of the horses were so
weakened by the arduous trail and by the insect pest that
they had to be shot before the journey was half over; at
the end of the trip only nine of the original 20 animals
remained.</p>
<p>During such journeys the animals find their food in the
native grasses which are very nourishing. There is in
Alaska, however, no natural curing of grasses such as
takes place in the arid states of the West. When frost comes, about the middle of September, the horse feed is
practically ruined. Therefore, the use of pack horses in
Alaska is pretty much limited to the season from June 1st
to the middle of September. By feeding grain one can
considerably extend the season, but as a horse will eat up
his own load in ten or fifteen days, such use is impractical for
long journeys.</p>
<p>Horse sleds, like pack animals, only came into general
use after the Klondike discovery. Their efficient use is
limited to roads which must be at least passable after the
winter snow comes. In the early days there was much
horse sledding over the ice of the Yukon and other rivers.
But even this implies the breaking of a trail, and the use of
horse sleds is now limited to established winter roads.
Before good sled roads were available, many so-called
“double enders” were in use. These are small sleds, not
unlike the freight sleds pulled by dogs, that are drawn by
a single horse or by two driven tandem.</p>
<p>Before trails passable for sleds were established, a mode
of transport called <i>raw hiding</i> was sometimes resorted
to. In this, freight was securely lashed into bales which were encased in raw hides, to which the traces of horses
were attached. Such bales could be dragged over any trail,
and even over bare ground, on which the horse could find
footing, for it was of no importance which side of the
load was on top. It was, of course, on account of the
friction, a very inefficient use of horse power and little, if
any, improvement over the back load. Now, where roads
have been built or other good sledding conditions are
found, winter horse freighting is by the familiar double-
or bobsled, known in all the northern states.</p>
<h3 id="reindeer">Reindeer</h3>
<p>During the early years of the introduction of reindeer
into Alaska much was said about their use for transport.
It was pointed out that the advantages of the reindeer
over the dog were that he found his own food, and could
be used as pack animal in the summer and sled puller in
the winter. The enormous use of reindeer transport in
Siberia appeared fully to justify these contentions; yet
after thirty years of reindeer breeding in Alaska, their use in
transport is almost negligible. In Siberia, a sled load of
270–300 pounds is easily hauled for long distances by
the reindeer. But these are the large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungusic_peoples">Tungus</a> animals
which average at least a third larger than the Alaskan
reindeer, are used as saddle animals, and will carry a
rider even through deep, soft snow; as pack animals they
will carry from 100 to 200 pounds. It is difficult to understand
why a similar use in Alaska has met with such
indifferent success. In the earlier days of the reindeer
experiments Laplanders were chiefly used for training both
the reindeer themselves and the Eskimos in their use. This
was undoubtedly, as can now be seen, a mistake. The
Laplander had both the ignorance and the lack of adaptability
to a new environment inherent to his semi-civilized
state. He was dealing with a Siberian animal much wilder
than the more highly domesticated one of his own land.
The small <i>pulka</i>, or Lapland sled, fashioned out of half
a log and rounded at the bottom, while making a good
passenger vehicle, was not adapted to hauling freight;
and the freight sled with runners was new to him. Moreover,
in Lapland, the reindeer was chiefly used to carry
men and light loads, and there was no use of the animal to transport heavy freight for long distances, such as had
been done in Siberia for many generations. As a means
of domesticating the Alaskan reindeer and of training
the natives in their use, the Laplander was almost a
complete failure.</p>
<p>Reindeer transport had, however, a more thorough test
by some of the mail contractors. These men with a keen
idea to business fully realized that if the reindeer could
be substituted for dogs there would be a material profit
in the change. The reindeer subsists on food of his own
finding, and it costs $75 to $100 a year to feed a dog. After
a period of careful test by men who had the initiative
of the frontiersman, the experiment of substituting reindeer
for dogs as mail carriers was on all but a very few
routes entirely abandoned.</p>
<p>There are some evident reasons why the reindeer could
not be substituted for the dog. Most of the established
dog team routes are along the large waterways, and in
the great inland regions of Alaska the lichen or reindeer
moss grows only on the highlands above the timber line. Obviously
the sled reindeer could not be driven to the highlands
to obtain its pasture. Local climatic conditions were
also an obstacle. A thaw followed by a freeze might cover
the pastures with ice and make the lichens unavailable
to the reindeer. In contrast to this, the general use of dog
teams made the furnishing of dried salmon for dog feed
a well-established industry along the waterocurses. The
reindeer will eat little except its regular food of lichens,
but the dog is omnivorous in its appetite. It should be
added, however, that the great tundra areas of Bering
Sea and of northern Alaska are the natural home of the
reindeer. The barren ground region has as yet but little
population save for the native whose mode of life has long
been adapted to the use of dogs. Hence the substitutuion of
the reindeer can only be brought about very gradually;
the change of a people from a nomadic to a pastoral life
must be a work of generation.</p>
<p>The following description by Jarvis illustrates the use of reindeer as sled animals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All hands must be ready at the same time when starting a deer
train, for, just as soon as the animals of the head team start,
they are all off with a jump, and for a short time keep up a very high
rate of speed. If one is not quick in jumping and holding on to his
sled, he is likely either to lose his team or be dragged along in the
snow. They soon come down to a moderate gait, however, and finally
drop into a walk when tired. They are harnessed with a well-fitting
collar of two flat pieces of wood, from which a trace goes back on
each side to the ends of a breast or single tree that fits under the
body. From the center of this a single trace runs back to the sled
either between or to ine side of the hind legs. In the wake of the
legs this trace is protected with soft fur, or the skin will soon be
worn through with the constant chafing. Generally, there is a single
line made fast to the left side of a halter and with this the animal
is to be guided and held in check; but this line must be kept slack
and on only when the deer is to be guided or stopped. By pulling
hard on this line, the weight of the sled comes on the head and
the animal is soon brought to a standstill, though often this is only
accomplished after he has gone in a circle several times and you
and the sleds are in a general mix-up. No whip is used and none
should be, for the deer are very timid and easily frightened and ince
gotten in that state are hard to quiet and control. A little tugging
on the lines will generally start them off even when they balk. The
sleds in use are very low and wide with very broad runners.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>During the past decade much advance has been made
in the training of sled deer by the Eskimo, mainly because
of the supervision and encouragement of W. T. Lopp and
his assistants of the Alaska Reindeer Service. The use of
sled deer is gradually becoming a part of the industrial
life of the Eskimo, and the more intelligent herders are
shoring an increasing facility in handling them. The
superintendents of the Alaska Native School and the Reindeer
Service are making much use of reindeer in their
winter journeys of inspection. The journeys of one winter
using reindeer aggregated 1,300 miles, and the average
normal day’s travel was 28 miles. It is also worthy of note
that native reindeer races have established a record of
ten miles in 27 minutes, 20 seconds and that the pulling
capacity of a single deer is 1,600 pounds for a distance
of 250 yards. A sled reindeer should make 25 miles a day
for a journey of 100 miles or so, hauling the driver and
50 or 75 pounds, perhaps 300 pounds in all. The reindeer
tire easily in soft snow and must then be frequently rested.</p>
<p>The argument for the use of reindeer is presented by
Carl O. Lind of the Alaska Reindeer Service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our trip, which demanded 45 days for its accomplishment, was successfully
done before Christmas. In all we traveled about 1,000 miles
under adverse conditions, and four out of seven deer made the return
trip without us, hauling 100 to 200 pounds. If dogs had been used they
could not have hauled their own provisions being picked up by themselves
whenever we stopped. No shelter was needed. When the most furious
wind sweeps its path, the deer simple faces it with an open mouth
and with an expression of satisfaction and joy… It goes uphill
and downhill alike. Trail or no trail, it will haul its 200 pounds or
more day after day; yes, week after week.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The argument against the use of reindeer has been presented
by the late Archdeacon Stuck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is not a dog less in Alaska because of the reindeer… Speaking
broadly, the reindeer is a stupid, unwieldy, intractable brute,
not comparing a moment with the dog in intelligence or adaptability…
The rein with which he is driven is a rope tied around
one of his horns. He has no cognizance of “gee” and “haw,” nor
of any other vocal direction, but must be yanked hither and thither
with the rope by main force; while to stop him in his mad career
once he is started it is often necessary to throw him with the rope.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Some use of the Alaskan reindeer as pack animals has been
made, but this mode of employment is not yet well developed.
The large Siberian reindeer will carry 100–150
pounds, but the smaller animal of Alaska will on the average
probably not carry over 50 pounds. The burden is carried
in cloth hampers hung over the animals and made secure
by a lashing going over the back and around the animal’s
belly. Unless thoroughly broken, the pack-bearing animal must be led. There appears to be no question that the pack
reindeer will find a use in the tundra regions where there
is not enough grass to support horses. Its employment
on long journeys has not been tested. Difficulties of herding
when the deer are in pasture present themselves, and as
yet but few reindeer have been broken to the pack.</p>
<p>The evidence in hand shows that the Eskimo reindeer
has clearly demonstrated the fact of the utility of the sled
reindeer to his mode of life. For his purpose the deer is
no doubt more suitable than the dog, for his life is spent
in the tundra region, where reindeer pastures are usually
abundant. On the other hand, experience up to the present
has shown that the needs of winter transport for the whites
can better be served by the dog and the horse than by the
reindeer. As has already be suggested, the value of the
reindeer to both native and white as a source of meat and
hides has been fully demonstrated.</p>
<p>It is roughly estimated that about 480,000 square miles
of Alaska’s area are, by virtue of the physical condition,
suited for winter dog transport. Of this area, about 220,000
square miles, or less than half, have the physical condition
that makes the use of reindeer practical. This gives a rough
measure of the relative value of the two draft animals; yet,
as has been shown, there are other factors which must
be given consideration in making this comparison.</p>
<h2 id="water-transport">Water transport</h2>
<p>Water transportation has been the savior of the province.
Without Alaska’s enormous coast line, aggregating
over twenty thousand miles, and her extensive river systems that
give access, though in part only with great difficulties,
to the most remote parts of the Territory, industrial advancement
would have been impossible. The Alaskan Yukon
and Kuskokwim basins include upwards of five thousand miles
of waters navigable for river steamers. It is these great
arteries of commerce that have served chiefly in the past
to open up the interior to settlement.</p>
<h3 id="hand-powered-craft">Hand-powered craft</h3>
<p>Long before any steamers had navigated these rivers,
these waters had been much used for transportation in
various ways. The inland natives of Alaska were, it is
true, a land folk who made relatively little use of the
rivers. Their only boat was a small bark canoe, too frail and light to be used for transport. Downstream journeys
were made by crude rafts and occasionally by a hastily
improvised skin boat made by the stretching of the hide
of a moose or caribou over an ill-constructed framework.
They had, however, no means of transportation upstream,
except the frail canoes which could be pushed against
only a slight current. As has already been shown, the
Russians were indifferent boatmen, and their clumsy river
craft were but ill-adapted to upstream navigation. the
first good river boats in Alaska were those introduced by
the Hudson Bay voyageurs whose boats included both the
double pointed bateaux, using both oars and poles as water
power, and the bark canoes.</p>
<p>There were, as has been previously pointed out, no trees
on the Yukon large enough for dugouts and, because of
the small size of the white or canoe birch trees, no possibility
for making practical large bark canoes. Therefore,
the Yukon pioneers were forced to provide boats built of
whipsawed lumber. This common type was a flat-bottomed
boat, sharply pointed at the bow and with a rather narrow
stern, of the general type of a dory, and some 18–24
feet long. Later the Yukon poling boat was devised. This
was a long, narrow, tapering craft, admirably adapted to
upstream journeys, against swift current and in shallow
water. The poling boat was 20–30 feet long, and amidships,
its bottom measured from 12 to 20 inches with
tapering sides, giving it 2½–3 feet of
beam at the gunwale. Though tapering rapidly at both
ends, it is usually built with snub nose at both bow and
stern. The Yukon poling boat was no doubt an adaptation
of similar types of craft long used on the western rivers.
Up to the time of the use of steamers, the Ohio River keelboats,
said to have been first used in 1793, with their
expert polers were the only crafts which would go upstream.
These Ohio River boats were 50 feet long, but
only 12–15 feet wide, and were propelled by ten polemen.
Their form and mode of use were identical with the
Mississippi craft.</p>

<p>It is surprising with what facility good polemen can push a loaded boat of this type up swift streams and with
barely enough depth of water to float the craft. With fair
conditions two good men could take a ton of supplies upstream
at the rate of 10–20 miles a day, and with a
lighter load. 30 miles a day were not uncommon. In the
early days of Yukon mining it was not infrequent for a
party of men to make the journey from Fortymile to
Lake Lindeman, the head of boat navigation, a distance
of nearly 600 miles, in a month, an average speed of nearly
20 miles a day. This included the time spent in making
the difficult portage around White Horse Rapids and Miles
Canyon, and also the easy navigation of Laberge and other
lakes of the upper Lewes River.</p>
<p><img src="pics/alaska/eskimo-tracking.webp" alt="Eskimo “tracking,” photo by A. H. Brooks"></p>
<p>In these upstream journeys propulsion by poling was
varied by <i>tracking</i>. This consisted in dragging the boat
by lines of men walking on the shore. By attaching two
lines to the boat, the men can readily steer it from the
shore; and if good footing can be obtained, they can drag
half a ton or more of supplies upstream at the rate of ten
miles or more a day. Where the stream is shallow and the
current swift, much wading is usually necessary to ease
the boat over the bars. Where there are steep-cut banks
and the water is too deep to pole, the boat must be pulled
by the bushes and trees along the banks. This method of
propulsion, formerly called “bushwhacking” on the Ohio
River, is slow and tedious; and a whole day may be consumed
to advance a few miles. It is not uncommon to use
dogs as draft animals in taking boats up streams.</p>
<p><img src="pics/alaska/peterborough.webp" alt="The Peterborough canoe made portages good highways (photo by J. B. Mertie)"></p>
<p>It was the Canadian explorers like William Ogilvie who
first introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterborough_Canoe_Company">Peterborough canoes</a> on the Yukon;
and later, this craft was much used by the Northwest
Mounted Police. Just as the poling boat has been the craft
of the prospector, so the canoe has been the craft of the
explorer. In general modeled after the Ojibwe bark canoe,
the Peterborough is an admirable swift water boat, carries
a large cargo, and is so light that it can be portaged a
long distance. This model is built in sizes varying from 17
to 24 feet in length with a beam of 40–52 inches. The
favorite canoe of the explorer is about 19 feet long and 46
inches wide. Such a boat built of cedar will, when dry,
weigh about 120 pounds, and in an emergency can be packed
by a single man across a portage. It will safely carry a
cargo of half a ton besides a crew of two or three men.
With a fair wind it makes a fairly good sailing craft.
When it is equipped with six-foot paddles, ten-foot poles,
and good tracking lines, there are no inland waters navigable
to any other craft on which a Peterborough canoe
can not be used. I have used a Peterborough provided with
a small coaming and canvas air-tight compartments
in fairly heavy weather on the Bering Sea. In river navigation,
punctures by snags or rocks of thin cedar planking
are not uncommon, but these are quickly and permanently
repaired by strips carried for the purpose. The Geological
Survey in the course of its explorations and investigations
in Alaska has used these canoes on about fifteen thousand miles of
the watercourses of Alaska. During the Klondike rush,
when every type of craft was used, folding canoes and
boats were not uncommon. Though easier to portage than
Peterboroughs, they are useless for upstream work, being
too flimsy to buck a current. They have found use in
explorations, because they can be packed on a horse and
transported overland and they are a necessity for cruising
rivers too deep to ford, the banks of which are untimbered.</p>
<h3 id="engine-powered-craft">Engine-powered craft</h3>
<p>The introduction of the light portable gas engine has
greatly modified Alaskan water travel. Many prospectors
avoid the labor of poling and tracking by its use. In
shallow rivers air propellors have been successfully used.
Nearly every Yukon Indian now has some sort of gas boat
to visit his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_wheel">fish wheels</a> and to travel from place to place.</p>
<p>Coastal navigation has also been completely revolutionized
during the past two decades by the gas engines.
Previous to 1900, the prospector and the fisherman traveled
chiefly in crafts propelled by sail and oars, but now the
use of power boats is almost universal. The favorite craft
is the Columbia River fishing boat, 20–30 feet long, of
the lifeboat type, and admirable for heavy weather. These,
formerly propelled solely by sail and oars, are now equipped
with economical heavyweight gas engines.</p>
<p>The Western Union Telegraph exploring expeditions had
for part of their project the steam navigation of the Yukon
River. Two flat-bottomed boats about 60 feet long, the
<i>Wilder</i> and the <i>Lizzie Horner</i>, were shipped to St. Michael
in 1866, but neither succeeded in entering the mouth of
the Yukon. Navigation of the Yukon continued by small
boat until the newly organized Alaska Commercial Company
brought in its first small steamer, the <i>Yukon</i>. This
boat was 50 feet long with 12-foot beams, was equipped
with two engines, and drew when loaded 18 inches of water;
it was built by John W. Gates of San Francisco. On July 4,
1869, with Captain Benjamin Hall as master and John R.
Forbes as engineer, the <i>Yukon</i> left Saint Michael and 27
days later arrived at Fort Yukon, having completed the
ferst steam navigation of the lower thousand miles of the
Yukon River. Within the next ten years, three other small
steamers were brought to the Yukon and navigated the
river up as far as Fort Selkirk,<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> 1,700 miles from the Bering
Sea. These boats were chiefly used in the fur trade, but
they also supplied the few prospectors then in the region.</p>

<p>With the influx of miners after the discovery of gold
in the Fortymile district, a larger vessel was demanded.
In 1889, the Alaska Commercial Company built the <i>Arctic</i>,<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>
140 feet in length with a 28-foot beam. By this time the
annual freight taken up the Yukon was largely the trading
goods and provisions to supply the Alaska Commercial
Company posts. Freight charges to the upper river were
$50 a ton, passenger rates $150. The freight rates were
very reasonable, and the passenger rates affected but few
of the miners, who arrived mostly by the Chilkoot Pass
route. In 1892, the North American Trading and Transportation
Company entered the Yukon as a rival in fur
trade and transportation. Their first boat, the <i>Portner B.
Ware</i>, of about the same size as the <i>Arctic</i>, ascended the
Yukon for some 200 miles in September, but was frozen in
before it reached the mining camps. The organization of
this company was due to the energy of J. J. Healy, a pioneer
Alaska fur trader. He long maintained a trading post at
Dyea, the gateway of Chilkoot Pass, and from information
obtained from the miners became convinced of the industrial
importance of the Yukon. As the managing head
of a great commercial company, he was a commanding
figure on the Yukon during the Klondike days, but he died
a pauper in 1910.</p>
<p>With the Klondike rush came an enormous expansion
of Yukon River traffic. In 1898 and 1899, between 75 and
100 steam-driven vessels were plowing the muddy waters
of the great river and its tributaries. In 1900, five transportation
companies were operating 33 river boats on the
Alaskan Yukon, and a dozen steamboats were navigating
the Canadian waters above. There is no record of the
traffic during the height of the Klondike travel; but in
1901, when it had greatly subsided, 35 boats carried 25,000
tons of freight up the Yukon, and the passenger traffic
upstream and downstream aggregated 2,500 persons. This
was at a time when the building of the White Pass &amp;
Yukon Railroad had, by establishing, a through freight and
passenger service from Skagway, greatly reduced the traffic
on the lower river. The tariffs were, in 1901, $85 a ton for
freight and $125 a passenger, from Saint Michael to Dawson.</p>
<p>During this period, large packets were built for the
Yukon service,<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> comparable to those used on the Mississippi.
Their masters and pilots were recruited from the Mississippi
and Columbia rivermen, the former having the prestige
of having operated large boats, the latter being more
experienced in handling steamers in swift water. The
large steamers had lengths of 222 feet, beams of 42 feet,
depths of 6 feet, and horsepower of 1,000. For many
years they were all wood burners, for the several attempts
to use the local lignitic coal were unsuccessful.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> In 1906,
many of the boats were changed to oil burners, the petroleum
being brought from California. These large packets
proved to be uneconomical, and there has been a gradual
change to smaller boats of from 400 to 600 tons which
could be efficiently used on the small tributaries of the
Yukon. With the decrease of gold mining, steamer traffic
has already decreased. In 1919, only nine steamers were
operated in the Alaskan Yukon, carrying a total of less
than 10,000 tons of freight.</p>
<p>In general, the Yukon is open to navigation from June
until October. The ice-free season, however, varies in different
parts of the basin. Above Dawson, the river is
usually clear of ice soon after the middle of May, and
steamers can be operated well into October. Navigation
on the lower Yukon is possible from the last week in May
until the end of September. The ice, however, often does
not go out of the Yukon delta until July, and the river
there may be frozen again by the middle of September.
One reason for the high freight rate on the Yukon is that
the expensive equipment and, to a certain extent, the
personnel too are idle for eight to nine months in the year.
All the profits must be made during the short season of
navigation.</p>
<h2 id="roads">Roads</h2>
<p>Nothing emphasizes the slow growth of means of transportation
in Alaska more than the history of its road construction.
The Russians during nearly a century of occupation
built less than five miles of wagon road in the
American possessions. During the next thirty years, up to
the time of the Klondike gold discovery, we added barely
another five miles to the total length of wagon road. At
the fiftieth anniversary of the annexation of Alaska, there
were only 980 miles of wagon road in the Territory,<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> an
area of nearly six hundred thousand square miles and a population then
of nearly seventy thousand. At this time, the Government had spent
a total of $3,970,000 on road and trail construction in
local taxes. Alaska had in turn produced minerals, fish
and fur up to a total value of $800,000,000. It is questionable
whether any other one country in the world has shown such a notable industial advancement with such a scant
outlay of public funds for transportation facilities.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="private-construction">Private construction</h3>

<figcaption><b>Early roads, I.</b> These roads were frequently crude affairs as is shown by the wagon road (left) up Gold Creek and that to the Jualin Mine in the Berners Bay district (right).<br /> Photos by C. W. Wright.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A little construction and some improvements of roads at
Sitka were done by the military authorities between 1867
and 1877, but beyond this bit, there was no building of
roads until after the discovery of the Juneau gold. In
1882, a horse trail was built by the miners for two miles
up Gold Creek, and later this was changed to a wagon
road which, by 1888, had been extended into the Silver
Bow basin. The building of this road in part through a
steep-walled valley was an expensive undertaking and all
of it was paid for by local mining industry. In 1898, a
law was passed, authorizing the construction and maintenance
of toll roads and bridges in Alaska,<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> a privilege
of which, however, few availed themselves. The Chilkat
Indians had long regarded the Chilkoot Pass trail as a toll
road owned by them, a monopoly which the pioneer miners
soon disregarded and claimed the right of carrying their
own burdens over it without charge. When the Klondike
rush started, a wagon road was constructed from tidewater
at Dyea for eight miles to the entrance of the canyon, and
during the height of the travel it carried on a brisk business.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1898 George A. Bracket completed fifteen
miles of wagon road from Skagway to the base of the final
steep thousand-foot climb leading to the summit of the White
Pass. This road traversed the heavily timbered flat of
Skagway River for some five miles, and beyond led along
the precipitous slopes of a rocky defile. At that time, the
Bracket road was the longest and most difficult piece of
highway construction that had been attempted in Alaska.
Remnants of this pioneer road are still visible from the
White Pass &amp; Yukon Railroad where they can be seen
clinging to the sides of precipitous cliffs. Bracket’s troubles,
however, did not end with the building of the road, for he
found it difficult to collect the toll of $20 a ton to which he
was legally entitled. Many Klodikers could see no reason
for paying toll on a route through which they had had a
sled trail before the building of the road. Some of the
toll collectors were roughly handled. But the controversy
over toll was short-lived, for by May of 1898 the railroad
surveyors had arrived and the railroad company bought
the wagon road,<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> both for the prevention of competition in
the haulage of freight and for hauling use in construction.</p>
<p>Jack Dalton, in 1898, built a horse trail from Pyramid
Harbor on Lynn Canal to the top of the pass at the head
of Klehini River. This opened up a route into the interior
well suited for horses and cattle which Dalton had explored.
No trail work was necessary beyond the pass where the
country was open. Dalton himself drove in several herd
of beef cattle and horses, reaching the Yukon either at
Five Finger Rapids or at Fort Selkirk at the mouth of the
Pelly. The Dalton trail was the best pack horse route into
the interior, but it was not much used even before the
completion of the railroad and the venture was not a
financial success.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, a few toll bridges have been
built at various places in Alaska. On the whole, however,
the toll road and bridge act of 1898 was entirely ineffective
in opening up Alaska.</p>
<h3 id="public-construction">Public construction</h3>
<p>In 1904, Congress made a second attempt to provide
roads for Alaska without appropriating any funds. This
effort compelled the United States commissioners to appoint
a road overseer in each district, who was to receive the
magnificent wage of $4 a day, the average wage at that
time being $6 to $10 a day. Recognizing that the poor
overseers would be at a financial loss for every day of
employment, the law specified that they were to be paid
for only ten days in the year. In this time these philanthropists
were not only to construct roads but also to notify
every man in their district that they must give two days’
work to road building each year, or in lieu thereof, to pay
a head tax of $8. This law was evidently framed on the
ancient statutes of many of the Eastern states, by which
road building was made the duty of every citizen, and a
knowledge of road engineering was recognized to be inborn
in every American. For generations, this ancient fallacy
hampered the development of good roads, and it was done
away with only after the inauguration of modern highway
construction.</p>
<p>No fault can be found with the principle of the Alaska
Road Act of 1904, of throwing the burden of road construction
on the Territory. But this should have been done
by a proper system of local taxes, and the funds collected
spent by qualified engineers. In Canadian territory, this
was recognized from the start, and the royalty collected on
the Klondike paid for the excellent system of highways
in the Yukon Territory. The Alaskan law was almost
futile in providing means of communication, though a few
local sled roads and trais were improved, most of which
were badly located and poorly constructed.</p>
<p>The extensive federal exploration of Alaska inaugurated
in 1898, chiefly by the Geological Survey and, for the first
few years, by the Army, included many long journeys.
Many of these exploring expeditions used horses and, incidental
to their advance, many miles of rough trail were
established. These were subsequently followed by others
and, in lieu of better trails, became established as routes
of travel. A few are still in use, and we still hear of the
<i>Gem Trail</i>, and the <i>Survey</i> and <i>Army</i> trails. Far
more important than these trails to betterment of means
of communication were the maps and reports which resulted
from the work of these expeditions. All had as
part of their mission the location of possible routes for
wagon roads and railroads. The actual areal mapping fell
chiefly to the Geological Survey which, before the epoch
of road and railroad construction that began some five
years later was inaugurated, had made contoured reconnaissance
maps of nearly all the routes which were subsequently
chosen or considered for wagon roads or railroads.
This work admirably furnishes conclusive proof
of the value of topographic maps. The cost of the areal
topographic surveys of Alaska has been far less than it
would have been had it been necessary to carry out explorations
for every road and railroad project. These maps gave
information on the best general route, and it was only
necessary for the engineer to make his location survey.</p>
<p>Many of the reports of this exploring expedition made
more or less definite recommendations for road and trail
construction. For example, in 1903, incidental to the discussion
of the future of placer mining,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> I recommended
that a million dollars be spent in building wagon roads to
the inland placer camps. The recommendation included a
road from Valdez to Eagle or Fairbanks as a main highway
and many other local roads. The opinion was then expressed
that several of the Yukon gold camps had probably
already spent more money in the transport of supplies
than the cost of wagon roads. This was probably an exaggeration,
but that such a generous project for wagon
roads was sound is proved by the fact that most of those
it included have, during the twenty years that have since
elapsed, been completed or are under construction.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="pics/alaska/bridge.webp" alt="The backpackers will probably cross an old-fashioned bridge (photo by F. H. Moffit)"></p>
<p>Though the trails established by these early exploring
expeditions were of use to the prospector, they were little
more than cuts through the timber, with here and there
some small bridges. The only actual trail construction by
such an expedition was that built under the direction of
Major W. R. Abercrombie, from Valdez inland. Abercrombie,
commanding the Copper River expedition of the
U.S. Army, landed at Valdez in the spring of 1898. His
parties, as already noted in Chapter 16, subsequently
made their way inland over the difficult an dangerous
Valdez Glacier route and also explored other passes through
the coastal mountain barrier. Abercrombie recommended
that a military trail be built inland from Valdez by a
route which would avoid the glacier. This was authorized
in 1899, and during the summer, Abercrombie constructed
a horse trail to the summit of Thompson Pass, thus surmounting
the most serious obstacle to inland travel. During
the following five years a crude pack trail was built through
to Eagle on the Yukon, under appropriations granted by
the War Department. Good service was rendered the pioneers
by this trail, but its construction is chiefly significant
in being a forerunner of splendid work done by the
Army in road construction in Alaska.</p>
<p>Since the law of 1904 was found futile in opening up
Alaska, a new statute was enacted in 1906. This provided
for an Alaska Road Commission of three Army officers,
one to be detailed from the Corps of Engineers. This board
was authorized to construct and maintain military and
post roads, bridges, and trails from funds collected by the
existing license taxes outside of incorporated towns. Thirty
percent of these taxes was reserved for maintenance of
schools for whites, and 25 percent for care of the insane;
the remainder was to be used for road construction and to
this was added a direct appropriation of $150,000. This
law marked the real beginning of road construction in
Alaska, and its beneficial effects have been felt throughout
the Territory ever since its enactment.</p>
<p>The original act left but little to to be desired. Its immediate
and continued success, however, was almost entirely due
to the fact that Brigadier General (then Major) Wilds P.
Richardson, a man of exceptional executive ability, was
chosen to be president of the board and continued in this
office until 1917 when he recalled for military duty.
At the time of his detail, General Richardson had had eight
years of almost continuous service in the Territory, during
which time he had pioneered on the Yukon, built trails, and
established Army posts. These duties had given him a
broad knowledge of Alaska and her people, and his duties
in road location and construction soon made him the leading
authority on the subject of Alaskan transportation. His
duties and responsibilities were arduous; for not only had
he to carry on road building under very adverse physical
conditions, but also he had to meet constant criticisms from
local residents who could not realize that an annual grant
of only a few hundred thousand dollars could not begin to
meet the needs for wagon roads.</p>
<p>Richardson was quick to grasp that the crux of the transportation
problem was to establish a trunk line of communication
between open waters on the Pacific and the
inland region. He, therefore, almost at once established a
sled road between Valdez on the coast and Fairbanks, the
largest settlement in the interior, a distance of 370 miles.
Year by year, this route was improved, and it passed by
successive stages, from dog trail, to sled road, to wagon road,
and finally to a fair automobile road. For years, this was a
main artery of mail routes and passenger trail into the
interior, and it has only recently been superseded by the
completion of the government railroad. Richardson’s vision
extended even further, for he conceived the bold project
of an extension of this road through to Nome, thus giving
an overland route to this remote community. This larger
project he unfortunately could not carry out because of lack
of funds. In addition to the main highway, now known
appropriately as the Richardson Road, many local roads
and trails were also built.</p>
<p>Richardson’s many years of service devoted to the interests
of Alaska are one of the outstanding features of
federal administration of Territorial affairs. After his
return to military duty, his work was most efficiently continued
by the officers of the Engineer Corps to whom the
task was assigned. By 1920, the Commission had built
4,890 miles of road and trail, of which 1,031 miles were
wagon road. There had been expended in construction and
maintenance a total of $5,498,000, of which $3,370,000 were
from direct appropriations and the rest from local taxes.
Meanwhile, some roads and trail had been built by the
Forest Service and by the Territorial Road Commission.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>
Thus great progress has been made, but the industrial needs
of the Territory demand at least an equal mileage of roads
and trails to that already constructed.</p>
<p>One of the most important acts of Congress for the
benefit of Alaska was the authorizing in 1900 of military
cable connection with Alaskan ports, the establishment of
land telegraph lines, and wireless stations. The original
act was passed, largely through the personal efforts of
Major General A. W. Greely, then chief signal officer.
Thanks to Greely’s efforts, cable communication with
Juneau and other Alaskan ports was established by 1903,
and by that time land lines had been extended over much
of the inland region.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Later, all important Alaskan towns
were given some from of electrical communication cable:
telegraph, telephone, or wireless.</p>
<p>The first aids to navigation in Alaskan waters were fourteen
buoys placed in Peril Strait in 1906.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> The hundreds of
vessels which traversed Alaskan waters during the Klondike
excitement, carrying thousands of passengers and millions
of dollars worth of freight, were transported through
these dangerous waters with hardly a single aid to navigation.
The losses of ships in Alaskan waters have been
appalling. These were in part, of course, due to the natural
physical conditions; but they are chargeable also to the
lack of sufficient aids to navigation and the lack of adequate
charts, a problem which the Coast Survey, with its
very limited facilities,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> has tried hard to meet. Alaska’s
vast shore line still has only one life-saving station, which
was established at Nome in 1905. The Revenue Cutter
Service, now the Coast Guard, has, however, from the beginning
of its cruises in northern waters rendered much
aid to wrecked vessels and has been the means of saving
many lives.</p>
