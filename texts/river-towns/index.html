<p>Much has been said and written about frontier life in Iowa. The grim
battles waged by the pioneer against droughts, locusts, prairie fires,
and blizzards have long been a favorite topic with the historians,
but the role of the Mississippi River has been curiously neglected.
Of course the stories of Dubuque, Davenport, Tesson, and Le Claire
are well known, but they belong more to the soil of Iowa than to its
great river.</p>
<p>Along the western banks of the Mississippi are little towns
that have been made and broken by the river. Many are quaint,
old-fashioned villages hugging the banks of the river and sheltered
by high bluffs from the cold winds that often sweep across the
outlying prairies. Quiet and serene, they give the impression of
being quite content with their situation, with never a dream of
expanding inland. They have an air of permanence, these old river
towns. Other settlements may be tentative communities of transient
pioneers, but the present inhabitants of the little river towns are
the grandchildren of the founders. Facing the river, they seem to
belong to it, having no desire to climb the bluffs and live on the
prairie beyond. Uneven sidewalks of flagstones, abandoned sawmills,
warehouses gauntly fronting the river and slowly sinking into decay,
the faint trace of a boat yard, an old boat landing now overgrown
with weeds and willows⁠—⁠are all mute evidences of a past that was
part of the great river. Drowsing away, living much in the past, these
towns seem to be awaiting the whistle of the long silent raft-boat
which will arouse them to activity once more.</p>
<p>Rambling, old houses of nondescript architecture line the streets that
parallel the river or cling to the steep hillsides of the diagonal
coulee. Since lumber was cheap, only the best material was used in the
mansions of a generation ago, and the rafts yielded their choicest
logs for the homes of the river men. Doors with transoms above and
kitchens finished like a steamboat cabin are eloquent reminders of
the owner&rsquo;s occupation. Occasionally, the pilot house or the cabin of
an old boat was the beginning of a comfortable residence of later days.</p>
<p>These are not typical country towns, for the farmer and the river man
had very little in common. The farmers came to trade and sell their
produce, but they were really outsiders, onlookers at the various
activities that filled the lives of the river folk. A certain dash,
an air of sophistication, and worldly experience born of many trips
to New Orleans and Saint Louis distinguished the dwellers of these
towns from their rural neighbors.</p>
<p>Transportation of both freight and passengers was made by boat.
As late as 1900, several towns in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_County,_Iowa">Scott County</a> boasted no railroad
connections with the outside world. A <i>hack</i> made daily trips of
fifteen or more miles from Le Claire to Davenport during the winter
months and steamboats served in the open season. The mail, carried by
rail to Illinois towns opposite, was ferried across to the Iowa shore.
And crossing the Mississippi in an open boat when the ice breaks up
in the spring is no enviable task.</p>
<p>The river man was a type. Just as the sea captain was devoted
to his ship, so was the river man devoted to the river and its
traditions. An aristocracy of the river was the natural product of
the golden age on the Mississippi. The names of captains, pilots, and
lumbermen were known from New Orleans to Saint Paul. Sons followed
in their father&rsquo;s wake and, learning river lore from childhood, they
often served apprenticeships as &ldquo;cub&rdquo; pilots under men who had been
associates of Mark Twain.</p>
<p>After the ice went out in the spring, every able-bodied man was ready &ldquo;to
go on&rdquo; a boat, and he stayed until the &ldquo;fleet&rdquo; laid up in October or
November (today, it may be only a government boat engaged in surveying,
dredging, or marking the river). With their season&rsquo;s earnings captains,
pilots, deck hands, and stokers all settled down to a comfortable
and idle winter. Of course, it can be truthfully said that many of
these families who enjoyed beefsteak in the fall probably ate liver
in the spring. But merchants were lenient in advancing credit, so why
bother about bills? No river man of the old school found employment
elsewhere when off the river, for he knew no other trade or business.</p>
<p>Saloons, gambling rooms, billiard parlors, dances, and other social
activities provided entertainment and recreation during the long winter
months. Show boats, which have recently found a place in American
literature, visited these river towns regularly. Just as the circus
band drew small boys to the tent, so did the calliope draw them to the
river bank. The saloon flourished above all other places of business,
drink being the greatest weakness of the river man. A town of about
two thousand inhabitants at one time boasted of thirteen saloons!
Tying up for the night at a town was the signal for a celebration,
and probably more than one member of the crew needed assistance in
returning to the boat. No wonder the notoriously tough river towns
were the object of many revivals and prayer meetings!</p>
<p>The typical river man was a genial fellow, liberal with his money
which went more easily than it came. He was not much worried about the
future, for he assumed that the river would always provide a living.
So it is that few river men died rich, and many in their old age
depended solely upon the small pension granted by former employers.</p>
<p>How the heart of the merchant in river towns was gladdened in those
old days when a steamboat whistled, and a boat was put out to shore, or
when a landing was made!  No wonder he slept above his store, for
boats came and went by night as well as by day. Once, while looking
through some papers in my father&rsquo;s desk, I found an old order for
supplies to be ready when the boat passed Le Claire. It contained
thirty-six items, including canned goods, fresh fruits and vegetables,
hams, toothpicks, soap, molasses, and brooms.  A footnote attached,
stating that only goods of the best quality would be accepted, was
proof that the crews were well fed, and that the packets spread a
bounteous table for the passengers.</p>
<p>River cooks were noted for their skill, and many favorite dishes among
the housewives in river towns today were originally prepared on the
steamers. With a great abundance of everything, the packet cooks found
no difficulty in creating dishes that would tempt the traveler. Three
or four kinds of meat, innumerable vegetables, both hot and cold
breads, fruits, and pastries were included in each meal. Indeed,
I have very pleasant childhood memories of stolen visits to a boat
whose cook was a favorite of all children, and never did we leave
empty-handed. Amusing stories are often related about these cooks; of
he who carried salt in one vest pocket and pepper in the other pocket,
and of the one who annually cast a pan of biscuits into the water in
memory of all river cooks who were dead.</p>
<p>Since life was centered about the river, it is only natural that the
arrival and departure of a boat was more or less of an event to the
children. Many youngsters learned to read by spelling out the names of
favorite boats, and such fascinating names they were⁠—⁠<i>Phil
Sheridan</i>, <i>Red Wing</i>, <i>Northwestern</i>, <i>LeClaire
Belle</i>,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <i>Eclipse</i>, <i>Diamond Jo</i>, <i>North Star</i>,
<i>Saturn</i>⁠—⁠all symbolical of romance and adventure. Mothers
constantly worried about their children playing on log rafts, or
riding the waves in small skiffs, and scarcely a season passed when
some child was not pulled out of the water more dead than alive. It
was perfectly natural that the river children took to the water like
ducks. Truant boys could usually be located along the river bank or on
small islands playing Robinson Crusoe in a shack of logs and willows.</p>
<p>Just as the cowboy had words and phrases peculiar to his life and
occupation, so the river man&rsquo;s vocabulary abounded in provincialisms
and characteristic terms. No little girl ever dreamed of calling a rope
other than a line, and all unskilled work on a boat was referred to as
<i>decking</i>. The cook&rsquo;s helpers were called &ldquo;slush-cooks&rdquo;; <i>roosters</i>
were the men employed on raft-boats, possibly so called because they
slept anywhere, always ready to go out on the raft. To address an old
river man by the title of <i>captain</i> was the height of flattery.</p>
<p>Of course, the river man was a teller of tales⁠—⁠many true, some the
delightfully improbable yarns spun on the deck, in the engine room,
or around a card table. Politics had no fascination for these men,
and rarely did a discussion of that kind disturb the minds or excite
the temper of the genial group. Stories of races between rival boats
(that most famous of all races between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee_%28steamboat%29"><i>Natchez</i> and the
<i>Robert E. Lee</i></a> still excites comment), storms on Lake Pepin,
tie-ups in Cattail Slough, broken rafts, black nights when the rain fell
in sheets and only instinct guided the pilot&rsquo;s hand, of the mate who
ruled his crew by carrying the spoke of a wagon wheel about with
him⁠—⁠all these and many more offer a rich field of romance and adventure
for the professional story-teller.</p>
<p>Tragedy stalked along the Iowa shores in Civil War times when cholera
raged along the river. When the <i>Canada</i>, a North Line packet
operating between Saint Louis and Saint Paul, cleared Saint Louis, she
was free from the dread disease.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> But case after case broke out, and
just below Le Claire a landing was made, and the victims were quickly
buried on a nearby bluff. The graves were marked by rude stones from
which the lettering has long since been obliterated by wind and sand.
And again from the lower Mississippi during the Civil War comes the
story of the <i>Sultana</i> which was blown up near Memphis, Tennessee,
and fourteen hundred Union soldiers lost their lives.</p>
<p>We children were much interested in one white-haired pilot who for
years brought a packet up from Saint Louis. He had given his dog
to some friends, and every time the packet whistled, &ldquo;Maje&rdquo; dashed to
the boat landing, eagerly and affectionately greeting his old master.
In his younger days, Maje had been trained to look through the boats
and barges for stowaways and seeping water. No watchman was needed
to bring out the former, and Maje&rsquo;s wet feet were proof of the latter.</p>
<p>Since the steamboats all had distinguishing whistles, no one needed to
scan the river to learn what boat was coming in. Only a few weeks ago,
I heard one of the few remaining steamers whistling a greeting to the
captain&rsquo;s wife as the boat went up the river.  But the long rafts,
carefully guarded by the &ldquo;tow-boat&rdquo; and the &ldquo;bow-boat&rdquo; which used
to float slowly past our house, have disappeared forever. Gone also
are the packets white and trim, and the &ldquo;side-wheelers&rdquo; churning the
water impatiently, with the captain on his bridge giving orders to
the sweating, hurrying crew, while presiding over all the bustle and
apparent confusion stood the pilot, serenely aloof and remote behind
his wheel, confident of his knowledge of an ever-changing river.</p>
<p>Possibly not many people know that the Mississippi contains a series
of rapids between the city of Davenport and the town of Le Claire.
A government canal and locks have done away with the necessity of
running the rapids, but before this canal was constructed, every boat
was steered over the rapids by a special pilot. Raft-boats never
ventured over these rapids at night, and when the water was low, the
raft was divided and taken over in sections.</p>
<p>Whoever has lived in an old river town who can not recall the ghostly
play of the lights along the shore as the pilot sought a landing;
the creak of the lowering gangplank; the shouts of the mate and the
crew as they made fast the lines? But the old river life is gone.
The last raft floated around the bend of the river fifteen years
ago, and many of the old river aristocracy and lesser members have
passed on. Only the quiet little river towns remain, sole relics of
the romantic time when the Mississippi was the principal highway to
Iowa, when steamboating was an art as well as a job, and when culture
and gaiety reigned in the ports on the Father of Waters.</p>
